    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_index: int
        The index of the sample to be generated, related to its place
        in a series. Imagine starting at t0, this is x=0, which places
        our unit circle at (1,0) and has a corresponding sine value
        of 0. At 2, we will be at 2pi radians and back again at 0. This
        combines with the sampling_rate and frequency however.
    frequency: float
        The frequency of the wave we'd like to generate samples for. Hz.
    amplitude: int
        The magnitude by which we'd like to increase our generated samples.
        Defaults to 16000, ensuring samples fall between -32000 and 32000,
        a two-byte range.
    sampling_rate: int
        How frequently we'd like to sample from our wave. Defaults to 44100,
        a traditional value for CD-quality sound.
