def ecg_fixpeaks(peaks, sampling_rate=1000):
    """Correct R-peaks location based on their interval (RRi).

    Low-level function used by `ecg_peaks()` to correct the peaks found by `ecg_findpeaks()`. See `ecg_peaks()` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks, troughs : list, array, DataFrame, Series or dict
        The samples at which the inhalation peaks occur. If a dict or a
        DataFrame is passed, it is assumed that these containers were obtained
        with `ecg_findpeaks()`.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signal that contains the peaks (in Hz,
        i.e., samples/second).

    Returns
    -------
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing additional information, in this case the
        samples at which R-peaks occur, accessible with the key "ECG_R_Peaks".
