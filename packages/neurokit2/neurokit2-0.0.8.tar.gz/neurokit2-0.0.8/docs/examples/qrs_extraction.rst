Extract and Visualize Heartbeats (QRS)
========================================

This example shows how to use NeuroKit to extract and visualize the QRS complexes (individual heartbeats) from an electrocardiogram (ECG).

Extract the cleaned ECG signal
-------------------------------

In this example, we will use a simulated ECG signal. However, you can use any of your signal (for instance, extracted from the dataframe using <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#neurokit2.read_acqknowledge>`_).

.. code-block:: python
    
    # Load the NeuroKit package
    import neurokit2 as nk

    # Simulate 30 seconds of ECG Signal (recorded at 250 samples / second)
    ecg_signal = nk.ecg_simulate(duration=30, sampling_rate=250)
    

Once you have a raw ECG signal in the shape of a vector (i.e., a one-dimensional array), or a list, you can use `ecg_process() <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#neurokit2.ecg_process>`_ to process it.

.. code-block:: python

    # Automatically process the (raw) ECG signal
    signals, info = nk.ecg_process(ecg_signal, sampling_rate=250)

This function outputs two elements, a *dataframe* containing the different signals (raw, cleaned, etc.) and a *dictionary* containing various additional information (peaks location, ...).

Extract R-peaks location
-------------------------

The processing function does two important things for our purpose: 1) it cleans the signal and 2) it detects the location of the R-peaks. Let's extract these from the output.

.. code-block:: python

    # Extract clean ECG and R-peasks location
    rpeaks = info["ECG_R_Peaks"]
    cleaned_ecg = signals["ECG_Clean"]
    
Great. We can visualize the R-peaks location in the signal to make sure it got detected correctly by marking their location in the signal.

.. code-block:: python

    # Visualize R-peaks in ECG signal
    nk.events_plot(rpeaks, cleaned_ecg)

Create segments of signal around the heart beats
-------------------------------------------------

Once that we know where the R-peaks are located, we can create windows of signal around them (of a length of for instance 1 second, ranging from 400 ms before the R-peak), which we can refer to as *epochs*.


.. code-block:: python

    # Segment the signal around the R-peaks
    epochs = nk.epochs_create(cleaned_ecg, events=rpeaks, sampling_rate=250, epochs_start=-0.4, epochs_duration=1)
    
This create a dictionary of dataframes for each 'epoch' (in this case, each heart beat).
    
Visualize all the heart beats segments 
---------------------------------------

You can now plot all these individual heart beats, synchronized by their R peaks with the `epochs_plot()` function.


.. code-block:: python

    # Plotting all the heart beats
    nk.epochs_plot(epochs)

Quick plot
-----------


You can get all of this and more in one line by using the `ecg_plot() <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#neurokit2.ecg_plot>`_ function on the dataframe of processed ECG.

.. code-block:: python

    nk.ecg_plot(signals)
