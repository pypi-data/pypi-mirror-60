LIXI
====

``lixi`` is a python package that simplifies working with the LIXI data standards and with messages that are based on the LIXI standards. 

[LIXI Limited]([https://lixi.org.au/) has been facilitating collaboration within the Australian Lending industry for almost two decades, by managing a suite of data standards (for both XML & JSON) used across the industry to improve the efficiency of B2B electronic messaging.

This package is offered under an open source license, however the features are effective when used in conjunction with a LIXI2 Schema which are available to LIXI members  and licensees.
