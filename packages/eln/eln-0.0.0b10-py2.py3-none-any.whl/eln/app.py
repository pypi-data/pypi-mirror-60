    # Note for contributors:
    #
    # Commands are auto-discovered if they are placed under the commands directory.
    # But please be sure to do the following for this to work:
    #   1. Name your package and click command the same.
    #   2. Place your command definition within your package's `main.py`
    #   3. Any sub-commands of your command should be added directly to your main command.
    #
    #   Access your command like so:
    #   `eln my-command my-sub-command`
    #
    #   If you would like to skip a plugin,
    #   simply rename the package by either prepending or an underscore (_)
    #   and any code contained within the package will be ignored.
