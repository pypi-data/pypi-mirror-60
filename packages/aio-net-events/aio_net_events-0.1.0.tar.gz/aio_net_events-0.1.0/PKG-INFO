Description: # aio-net-events
        
        `aio-net-events` is a Python library that provides asynchronous generators
        yielding events when the network configuration of the machine changes.
        Currently only network interface additions / removals and IP address additions /
        removals are supported; more events may be added later.
        
        Supports Windows, Linux and macOS at the moment.
        
        Requires Python >= 3.5.
        
        Works with [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html),
        [`curio`](https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
        [`trio`](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
