# aio-net-events

`aio-net-events` is a Python library that provides asynchronous generators
yielding events when the network configuration of the machine changes.

removals are supported; more events may be added later.

Supports Windows, Linux and macOS at the moment.

Requires Python >= 3.5.

Works with [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html),
[`curio`](https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[`trio`](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Installation
