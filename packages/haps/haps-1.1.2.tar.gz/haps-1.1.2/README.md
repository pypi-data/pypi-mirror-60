# haps [![PyPI](https://badge.fury.io/py/haps.png)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/haps/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lunarwings/haps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lunarwings/haps)
Haps [Ï‡aps] is a simple DI library, with IoC container included. It is written in pure Python with no external dependencies.

Look how easy it is to use:

```python
from haps import Container as IoC, Inject, inject

# import interfaces
from my_application.core import IDatabase, IUserService


class MyApp:
    db: IDatabase = Inject()  # dependency as a property

    @inject  # or passed to the constructor
    def __init__(self, user_service: IUserService) -> None:
        self.user_service = user_service

IoC.autodiscover('my_application')  # find all interfaces and implementations

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = MyApp()
    assert isinstance(app.db, IDatabase)
    assert isinstance(app.user_service, IUserService)
```
