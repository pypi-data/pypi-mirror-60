PyStatsBatteries
========================================================

PyStatsBatteries is a Python library for dealing with statistical and graphic tools for your
dataframes.

This library provides several tools directly loaded into your virtual environment, and 
also example notebook on using this tools.
It is maintained by a team of researchers at 'Laboratoire de Réactivité et Chimies 
du Solide', (Amiens, FRANCE), as part of ARTISTIC project.

Please, do not hesitate to discover the team of researchers behind the librairy and also the ARTISTIC project
also involved : [ARTISTIC](https://www.u-picardie.fr/erc-artistic/?L=0)


Setup
========================================================

For installation and usage, it doesn't work with python2.x and under versions as there 
are dependencies issues. 
We ask you to get a virtual environment such as **conda**.

Note that you need to follow the way below :

1. Clone the repository
2. Enter into the directory at the root where the **setup.py** file is located

Now open a terminal and try theses command lines :
```python
pip install PyStatsBatteries
```
or 
```python
python setup.py install
```


Example
========================================================


There is an example notebook providing what the library is able to do. Check it 
directly on the Github page, or with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) on your own session.

##### Run a test

```python
from PyStatsBatteries.Descriptors import *
import pandas as pd

Data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/dataframe.csv')

d = Descriptors()
d.Per_feature(Data, "Feature1")
```
