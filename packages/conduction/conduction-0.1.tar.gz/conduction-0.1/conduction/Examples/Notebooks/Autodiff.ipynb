    "Imagine you want to test out a new machine learning model for your data. This usually means coming up with some loss function to capture how well your model fits the data and optimizing that loss with respect to the model parameters. If there are many model parameters (neural nets can have millions) then you need gradients. You then have two options: derive and code them up yourself, or implement your model using the syntactic and semantic constraints of a system like Theano.\n",

    "We want to provide a third way: just write down the loss function using a standard numerical library like numpy, and autograd will give you its gradient."
