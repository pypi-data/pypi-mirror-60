#Define user parameters:

#1. Specify study area: Study area
#Can specify a country, provide a fusion table  or asset table (must add 
#.geometry() after it), or draw a polygon and make studyArea = drawnPolygon
studyArea =  ee.Feature(ee.Geometry.Polygon(\

          [-121.09204983511518, 39.25666609688575]]]))

#2. Update the startJulian and endJulian variables to indicate your seasonal 
#constraints. This supports wrapping for tropics and southern hemisphere.
#startJulian: Starting Julian date 
#endJulian: Ending Julian date
startJulian = 190
endJulian = 250

#3. Specify start and end years for all analyses
#More than a 3 year span should be provided for time series methods to work 
#well. If using Fmask as the cloud/cloud shadow masking method, this does not 
#matter
startYear = 2017
endYear = 2019

#4. Specify an annual buffer to include imagery from the same season 
#timeframe from the prior and following year. timeBuffer = 1 will result 
#in a 3 year moving window
timebuffer =0

# 5. Specify the weights to be used for the moving window created by timeBuffer
#For example- if timeBuffer is 1, that is a 3 year moving window
#If the center year is 2000, then the years are 1999,2000, and 2001
#In order to overweight the center year, you could specify the weights as
#[1,5,1] which would duplicate the center year 5 times and increase its weight for
#the compositing method
weights = [1]



#6. Choose medoid or median compositing method. 
#Median tends to be smoother, while medoid retains 
#single date of observation across all bands
#If not exporting indices with composites to save space, medoid should be used
compositingMethod = 'medoid'

#7. Choose Top of Atmospheric (TOA) or Surface Reflectance (SR) 
#Specify TOA or SR
#SR S2 data also has a terrain correction applied which may or may not be best depending on how you are using the data
#If using data from humid climates, terrain correction can be useful. Since vegetation types differ with respect to slope/aspect 
#in dryer climates, terrain correction can remove some of the signal in dryer climates.  In higher latitudes terrain correction can fail.

# 10. Choose cloud/cloud shadow masking method
# Choices are a series of booleans for applyQABand, applyCloudScore, 
#applyShadowShift, and applyTDOM
#CloudScore runs pretty quickly, but does look at the time series to find areas that 
#always have a high cloudScore to reduce comission errors- this takes some time
#and needs a longer time series (>5 years or so)
#TDOM also looks at the time series and will need a longer time series
#QA band method is fast but is generally awful- don't use if you like good composites
#Shadow shift is intended if you don't have a time series to use for TDOM or just want individual images
#It will commit any dark area that the cloud mask is cast over (water, hill shadows, etc)

#If performCloudScoreOffset = true:
#ercentile of cloud score to pull from time series to represent a minimum for 
#the cloud score over time for a given pixel. Reduces comission errors over 
#cool bright surfaces. Generally between 5 and 10 works well. 0 generally is a
#bit noisy but may be necessary in persistently cloudy areas

#   shadow shift method (lower number masks out less)

#contractPixels: The radius of the number of pixels to contract (negative 
#   buffer) clouds and cloud shadows by. Intended to eliminate smaller cloud 
#   patches that are likely errors
#(1.5 results in a -1 pixel buffer)(0.5 results in a -0 pixel buffer)
#(1.5 or 2.5 generally is sufficient)
contractPixels = 1.5

#dilatePixels: The radius of the number of pixels to dilate (buffer) clouds 
#   and cloud shadows by. Intended to include edges of clouds/cloud shadows 
#   that are often missed
#(1.5 results in a 1 pixel buffer)(0.5 results in a 0 pixel buffer)
#(2.5 or 3.5 generally is sufficient)
dilatePixels = 2.5

#Choose the resampling method: 'near', 'bilinear', or 'bicubic'
#Defaults to 'near'
#If method other than 'near' is chosen, any map drawn on the fly that is not
#reprojected, will appear blurred
#Use .reproject to view the actual resulting image (this will slow it down)
resampleMethod = 'near'

# 12. correctIllumination: Choose if you want to correct the illumination using
# Sun-Canopy-Sensor+C correction. Additionally, choose the scale at which the
# correction is calculated in meters.
#Currently not supported for S2
correctIllumination = False
correctScale = 250#Choose a scale to reduce on- 250 generally works well

#13. Export params
#Whether to export composites
exportComposites = False

#Set up Names for the export
outputName = 'S2_'

#Provide location composites will be exported to
#This should be an asset folder, or more ideally, an asset imageCollection

#Common crs codes: Web mercator is EPSG:4326, USGS Albers is EPSG:5070,
