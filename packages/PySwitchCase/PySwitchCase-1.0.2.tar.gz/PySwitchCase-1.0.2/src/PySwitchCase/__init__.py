I thought of a way to efficiently do a c++ style switch case in Python 3.7+. Should work for Python 3.6. Haven't tested for older versions of Python.

I would like feedback, however, if there any ways to improve it. Please see the docstring for the SwitchCase class for usage examples. I do plan on making a package for it soon.
