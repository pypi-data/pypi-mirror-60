        About
        -----
        
        *dramaTTS* parses scripts (plain text files) for theatre/screen plays and converts them into a multi-voice audio plays
        (wave-files).
        
        While the script parsing functionality is provided by the *dramaTTS* program itself, it relies on external tools for
        the audio processing:
        
        * The `Festival Speech Synthesis System`_ (herein referred to as *Festival*) is used for speech synthesis
        * `Sound eXchange (SoX)`_  for audio post-processing.
        
        *SoX*, *Festival* as well as voices and lexicons for *Festival* have to be installed in order to create audio output
        with *dramaTTS*.
        
        See the `dramaTTS documentation`_ for more details
        
        Licenses
        --------
        
        *dramaTTS*, Copyright (c) 2020 Thies Hecker
        
        *dramaTTS* is free software released under the GPLv3 license (see the full disclaimer in COPYING_ and the LICENSE_
        file for details).
        It is written *python* and you can download the source code from `dramaTTS's gitlab page`_.
        
        *dramaTTS* is realized using:
        
        PyQt_, Copyright (c) Riverbank Computing Limited
        
        and
        
        setuptools_scm_, Copyright (c) Ronny Pfannschmidt.
        
        While *dramaTTS* is a standalone application, it is of limited use without *Festival* and *SoX* being installed,
        which provide the audio rendering (only script parsing including syntax highlighting, etc. is available).
        
        While the *Festival* application itself and *SoX* are released under free software licenses as well,
        specific components, which are commonly bundled with *Festival* (i.e. certain lexicons and voices) may be released
        under non-free licenses.
        
        For instance the *festlex-OALD* lexicon, which can be found among other files (incl. the source code of the latest
        *Festival* release) on the `Festvox 2.5 release page`_ lexicon is restricted to non-commercial use only.
        
        The `dramaTTS documentation`_ will provide an example for a *Festival* distribution based on *free* components only.
        
        Please see the COPYING_ file in the source code repository for details on licenses and copyright disclaimers of the
        individual components.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        As mentioned above *dramaTTS* consists of 2 main components: a script parser and a scheduler/configurator for
        the audio-rendering.
        
        The script parser features:
        
        * configurable input file formatting
        * syntax highlighting (identifies different content like new scenes, dialogue lines, narrative descriptions,...)
        * text string substitutions supporting regular expressions
        * some utility functions like sorting speakers according to their number of text lines
        
        The audio-renderering part basically provides a front-end to *Festival* and *SoX* with following features supported:
        
        * Altering of *Festival* voices (pitch, tempo and volume)
        * support for multiple CPU cores to accelerate audio rendering (dispatches parallel processes for individual lines)
        * using a *Festival* server for rendering is supported
        * some post-processing: normalize all voices, combine audio files (lines -> scenes -> single project file)
        * (re-)rendering of individual scenes or speakers
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        You will need a python3 distribution installed and for most convenience you should have either the *pip* or *conda*
        package manager installed.
        
        On linux you will most likely have python and pip already installed - if not you should be able to install them with
        distributions package-manager.
        
        E.g. for debian based system like ubuntu just run:
        
        .. code::
        
            sudo apt-get python3-pip
        
        or on arch based:
        
        .. code::
        
            sudo pacman -S python-pip
        
        For Windows users I would recommend to install Anaconda_ or miniconda_, which will provide the *conda* package
        manager (make sure to get the python3 - not the python2 - version!).
        
        To install *dramaTTS* with pip:
        
        .. code::
        
            pip install dramatts
        
        Note, that on some distributions you may install python2 and python3 in parallel. In such cases you should make sure,
        that you not using a pip for your python2 environment to install *dramaTTS*. Eventually you need to use pip3 as a command.
        You can check if you are using the correct pip by calling:
        
        .. code::
        
            pip --version
        
        To install *dramaTTS* with conda:
        
        .. code::
        
            conda install -c thecker dramatts
        
        In both cases pip or conda should download all required dependencies and should be able to launch the program.
        To do that just type:
        
        .. code::
        
            python -m dramatts.dramatts_gui
        
        The GUI should pop up and you can import text files, define roles etc., but you will not be able render audio unless
        you have installed *Festival* (and its components) and *SoX*.
