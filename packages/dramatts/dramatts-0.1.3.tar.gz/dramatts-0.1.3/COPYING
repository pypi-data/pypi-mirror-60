Notes:
------

Although "dramaTTS" runs as a standalone application, it is of limited use without the "Festival Speech Synthesis
System" (herein referred to as "Festival") - with its command line tools "festival", "festival_client" and "text2wave" -
and "Sound eXchange (SoX)" - with its command line tools "sox" and "play" - being installed (both applications are
herein also referred to as "external components").
These external components provide the audio rendering & post-processing functionality - without them "dramaTTS" only
provides script parsing including syntax highlighting, etc.

While the "Festival" application itself and "SoX" are released under free software licenses as well (see details below),
specific components, which are commonly bundled with "Festival" (i.e. certain lexicons and voices) may be released
under non-free licenses.

For instance the "festlex-OALD" lexicon, which can be found among other files (incl. the source code of the latest
"Festival" release) on the Festvox 2.5 release page is restricted to non-commercial use only.

In order to create a "free" "Festival" distribution the documentation of "dramaTTS" provides a list of components for
"Festival", which could form such a "free" distribution (see "dramaTTS" README - "Installing Festival without non-free
components").

Note, that this selection was created on best knowledge with the intention to provide "free" environment for "dramaTTS",
without any violation of the licenses of the individual software components used. In order to assure, that the external
components are suitable for your intended application make sure to check their licenses yourself.

The copyright disclaimers/licenses of the selected components are given below.


Copyright disclaimers/licenses of selected components
-----------------------------------------------------

Below the licenses of linked 3rd party libraries used in "dramaTTS" as well as the external tools and its components
to create a fully functional "dramaTTS" environment are given. The number in parenthesis gives the version number
of the component from which the copyright disclaimers/license information was taken.

Used Libraries belonging to the python standard library are not listed individually - see the following chapter

Some further comments:

Every effort has been made to ensure that Festival does not contain
any violation of intellectual property rights through disclosure of
trade secrets, copyright or patent violation.  Considerable time and
effort has been spent to ensure that this is the case.  However,
especially with patent problems, it is not always within our control
to know what has or has not been restricted.  If you do suspect that
some part of Festival cannot be legally distributed please inform us
so that an alternative may be sought.  Festival is only useful if it
is truly free to distribute.

As of 1.4.0 the core distribution (and speech tools) is free.  Unlike
previous versions which had a commercial restriction.  You are free to
incorporate Festival in commercial (and of course non-commercial
systems), without any further communication or licence from us.
However if you are seriously using Festival within a commercial
application we would like to know, both so we know we are contributing
and so we can keep you informed of future developments.  Also if you
require maintenance, support or wish us to provide consultancy feel
free to contact us.

The voices however aren't all free.  At present the US voices, kal and
ked are free. Our British voices are free themselves but they use OALD
which is restricted for non-commercial use.  Our Spanish voice is also
so restricted.

Note other modules that festival supports e.g MBROLA and OGI
extensions, may have different licencing please take care when using
the system to understand what you are actually using.

SoX source code is distributed under two main licenses. The two

sox.c, and thus SoX-the user application, is distributed under the

restrictive LGPL.

Note that some of the external packages that can be linked into libsox
are GPLed and/or may have licensing problems, so they can be disabled
at configure time with the relevant--with-* options. If libsox is built
with such libraries, it must be distributed under the GPL.
