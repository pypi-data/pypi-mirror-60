Description: 
        Started in 2003 as a flac to ogg vorbis converter, flac2All has grown into a multiprocess, network clustered program that will convert your collection of FLAC files into mp3,ogg vorbis,opus,flac,aac and another 60+ audio formats, complete with any tags that the source file had. Designed to be extended with new formats easily as time goes on, it is a utility for people with with large FLAC collections who want a way to convert multiple files in parallel.
        
        Tested on Linux and FreeBSD, let me know how it works on other Unix OS'es.
