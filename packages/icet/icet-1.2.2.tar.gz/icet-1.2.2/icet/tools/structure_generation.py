        the kind of lattice to be occupied
    target_concentrations
        concentration of each species in the target structure (for
        example `{'Ag': 0.5, 'Pd': 0.5}`)

        Concentrations are always expressed with respect to all atoms in
        the supercell, which implies that the sum of all concentrations
        should always be 1. In the case of multiple sublattices, a valid
        specification would thus be `{'Au': 0.25, 'Pd': 0.25, 'H': 0.1,
        'V': 0.4}`.
