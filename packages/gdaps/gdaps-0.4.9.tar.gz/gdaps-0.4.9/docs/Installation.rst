Installation
============

Install GDAPS in your Python virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install gdaps


Create a Django application as usual: ``manage.py startproject myproject``.

Now add "gdaps" to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` section, and add a special line below it:

.. code-block:: python

    from gdaps.pluginmanager import PluginManager

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ... standard Django apps and GDAPS
        "gdaps",
    ]
    # The following line is important: It loads all plugins from setuptools
    # entry points and from the directory named 'myproject.plugins':
    INSTALLED_APPS += PluginManager.find_plugins("myproject.plugins")

You can use whatever you want for your plugin path, but we recommend that you use "**<myproject>.plugins**" here to make things easier. Basically, this is all you really need so far, for a minimal working GDAPS-enabled Django application. See :doc:`usage` for how to use GDAPS.

Logging
-------
Django does not write loggings to the command line automatically. GDAPS uses various levels of logging. It is recommended that you create a LOGGING section in settings.py for GDAPS:

.. code-block:: python

    LOGGING = {
        "version": 1,
        "disable_existing_loggers": False,
        "handlers": {"console": {"class": "logging.StreamHandler"}},
        "loggers": {
            "gdaps": {"handlers": ["console"], "level": "INFO", "propagate": True},
        },
    }

This will output all GDAPS log messages to the console.

Frontend support
----------------

If you want to add frontend support too your project, you need to do as follows:

Add ``gdaps.frontend`` (before  ``gdaps``), and ``webpack_loader`` to Django.

Frontend engines are packed in plugin eggs. You can easily install them using pip, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install gdaps-frontend-vue

Then you have to tell Django which engine to use:

.. code-block:: python

    GDAPS = {
        "FRONTEND_ENGINE": "vue",
    }

Further configuration may be necessary depending on your frontend plugin.
Available plugins ATM:

* `Vue <https://gdaps-frontend-vue.readthedocs.io>`_
* PySide (currently only stub)

There are some keys in this section to configure:

FRONTEND_DIR
    This is the directory for the frontend, relative to DJANGO_ROOT.
    Default is "frontend".

FRONTEND_ENGINE
    The engine which is used for setting up a frontend. ATM it can only be "vue". In future, maybe other engines are supported (Angular, React, etc.). PRs welcome.

FRONTEND_PKG_MANAGER
    This is the package manager used to init/install packages. ATM you can use "yarn" or "npm". Default is *npm*.

and finally add the URL path for redirecting all to the frontend engine:

.. code-block:: python

    # urls.py
    from gdaps.pluginmanager import PluginManager

    urlpatterns = PluginManager.urlpatterns() + [
        # ... add your fixed URL patterns here, like "admin/", etc.
    ]

Now you can initialize the frontend with

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py initfrontend

This creates a basic boilerplate (previously created with 'vue create' and calls *yarn install* to
install the needed javascript packages.
