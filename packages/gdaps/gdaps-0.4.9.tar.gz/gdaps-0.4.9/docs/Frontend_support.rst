Frontend support
================

GDAPS supports frontends for building e.g. SPA applications.
ATM only Vue.js ist supported well, but PRs are welcome to add more (Angular,
React?). Even PySide is possible.

Install
-------

Add ``gdaps.frontend`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, **before** ``gdaps``.

The included `gdaps.frontend` package provides basic tools which then can be extended by other plugins, like `gdaps-frontend-vue`. You have to install at least one frontend plugin, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install gdaps-plugin-vue


GDAPS detects it automatically and makes the "vue" FRONTEND_ENGINE available in settings.py.

.. code-block:: python

    GDAPS = {
        "FRONTEND_ENGINE": "vue",
        "FRONTEND_DIR": "frontend",
        "FRONTEND_PKG_MANAGER": "",
    }

There are some keys here to configure:
    
FRONTEND_ENGINE (mandatory)
    The engine which is used for setting up a frontend. 
    ATM it can only be "vue" or "pyside".
    See the [gdaps-frontend-vue package](gdaps-frontend-vue.readthedocs.org)

FRONTEND_DIR (optional)
    This is the directory for the frontend, relative to DJANGO_ROOT.
    **Default is "frontend".**

FRONTEND_PKG_MANAGER (optional)
    This is the package manager used to init/install packages. 
    ATM you can use "yarn" or "npm". **Default is *npm*.**


Management Commands
-------------------

There is a new
management command available. Set the ``GDAPS["FRONTEND_ENGINE"]`` to your desired engine ("vue", "pyside"), and call:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py initfrontend

This creates a /frontend/ directory in the project root, and installs a frontend application there. The type of frontend (and installation) depends on what you have selected in ``GDAPS["FRONTEND_ENGINE"]``.

So all you have to do is:

#. Add ``gdaps.frontend`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` (before ``gdaps``)
#. Install a frontend plugin, like `pip install gdaps-frontend-vue`.
#. Execute ``./manage.py initfrontend``
#. Call ``./manage.py startplugin fooplugin``
#. Call ``./manage.py syncplugins``
#. start ``yarn serve`` in the *frontend* directory
#. start Django server using ``./manage.py runserver``

To remove a plugin from the frontend, just remove the backend part (remove it from INSTALLED_APPS or uninstall it using pip) and call ``manage.py syncplugins`` again. It will take care of the database models, and the uninstallation of the frontend part.
