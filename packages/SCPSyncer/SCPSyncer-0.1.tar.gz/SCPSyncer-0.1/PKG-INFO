Description: # SCPSyncer
        SCPSyncer is a python module that syncs files to a remote machine.
        It does this by calculating file hashes on both sides, and pushing the files that have different hashes to the remote machine.
        
        ## Configuration files
        There are 2 files that configure the behaviour of syncing
        
        ### .syncconfig
        `.syncconfig` is a YAML file with the sync configuration
        ```yaml
        CONFIG_NAME:
          inherit: CONFIG_NAME OF OTHER CONFIGURATION TO INHERIT MISSING KEYS FROM
          host: IP_OR_HOSTNAME
          user: USERNAME
          password: PASSWORD
          target_path: /PATH/ON/REMOTE
          commands:
            sync_start: COMMAND TO EXECUTE BEFORE SYNCING
            post_hash: COMMAND TO EXECUTE AFTER HASHES ARE CALCULATED
            sync_end: COMMAND TO EXECUTE AFTER SYNCING
          diff_extensions: ['.py', '.json']   # EXTENSIONS OF FILES THAT SHOULD HAVE DIFFS PRINTED
          diff_only: SET TO TRUE IF IT SHOULD JUST CALCULATE HASHES AND PRINT DIFFS
        ```
        
        ### .syncignore
        A text file with globs of files to ignore when syncing - same structure as .gitignore file.
        Multiple `.syncignore` files can be in (sub)directories
