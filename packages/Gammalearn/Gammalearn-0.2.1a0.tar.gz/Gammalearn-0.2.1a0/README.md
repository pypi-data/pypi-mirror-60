<b><i>Deep learning applied to the Cherenkov Telescope Array data analysis.</b></i>
</p>

GammaLearn is a collaborative project to apply deep learning to the analysis of low-level Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes such as CTA.    
It provides a framework to easily train and apply models from a configuration file.

## Implementation

### Dependencies

- PyTorch (>= 1.2)
- Numpy
- PyTables
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- Ignite
- tensorboardX
- TensorBoard
- IndexedConv
- ctapipe

### Installation procedure

We recommend the use of Anaconda with Python 3.7. 
```
conda install gammalearn -c http://conda.anaconda.org/gammalearn
```

Install with pip
```
pip install gammalearn
```

Install from source:
```
git clone --shallow-since 2019-04-01 https://lapp-gitlab.in2p3.fr/GammaLearn/GammaLearn
cd GammaLearn
python setup.py install
```


## Usage
First activate your conda environment

To run an experiment
```
gammalearn path_to_your_experiment_settings_file.py
```
you can find an example of setting file in https://lapp-gitlab.in2p3.fr/GammaLearn/GammaLearn/example and some sample data in https://lapp-gitlab.in2p3.fr/GammaLearn/GammaLearn/share/data

To visualise the results from your experiment, GammaLearn integrates with
[GammaBoard](https://github.com/vuillaut/ctaplot) that provides high-level metrics and plots to assess IACTs reconstruction performances

To visualise the convolution kernels of your trained network (experimental feature)
```
gexplore-net path_to_your_experiments experiment_name checkpoint_version
```
