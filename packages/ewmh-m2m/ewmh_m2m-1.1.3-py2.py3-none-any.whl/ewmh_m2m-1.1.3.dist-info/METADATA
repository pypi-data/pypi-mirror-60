Rationale
=========

I love XFCE. I use it on almost all my computers.
However, in a multi head setup, it lacks a "move window to monitor" feature.
Some posts link to the `move-to-next-monitor`_ script, which as many dependencies and is not very customizable
(move to bottom, to right, etc.)

Hence, here it is ewmh_m2m.

Install
=======

Just install the package with pip::

    pip install ewmh-m2m  # Note the dash and not the underscore!

You should now have a ``move-to-monitor`` command available.

Usage
=====

You should bind the ``move-to-monitor`` command to your desired keyboard shortcut.
This command also accepts some arguments to control where the window is moved.
Type ``move-to-monitor --help`` in a terminal for the list of accepted options.


Development
===========

Feel free to ask some features on `GitHub`_.
You can also develop your own features and open Pull Requests.
Take a look at the `technical documentation`_.
