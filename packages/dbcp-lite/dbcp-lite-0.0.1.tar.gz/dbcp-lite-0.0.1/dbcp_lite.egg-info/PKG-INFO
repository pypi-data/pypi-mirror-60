Description: # DBCP Lite
        
        A simple, light and nearly featureless database connection pool for Python.
        
        Connections are added to the pool as needed up to `max_size` in number.
        Once added the connections will remain in the pool and no attempt is made
        to shrink the pool. In most cases it is recommended to set 
        `min_size == max_size`.
        
        # Usage
        
        ```python
        import cx_Oracle
        from dbcp_lite import DBConnectionPool
        
        connect_args = ('scott', 'tiger', 'dbhost.example.com/orcl')
        pool = DBConnectionPool(cx_Oracle.connect, 
                                create_args=connect_args, 
                                create_kwargs={'threaded': False}, 
                                min_size=1, 
                                max_size=4, 
                                name='scott@orcl')
        
        with pool.acquire() as connection:
            ...
        
        with pool.acquire_cursor() as cursor:
            ...
        
        pool.close()
        ```
        
        The `acquire_cursor()` is a convenience method that returns a `Cursor` using a
        `Connection` from the pool. Upon successful completion `commit()` will be
        called on the `Connection` and the `Cursor` will be closed.
        
        ## Timeouts
        
        A timeout can be provided to various methods. If no connections are available to
        be `acquired` or `closed` the methods will raise a `PoolTimeout` exception.
        
        # Lifecycle Methods
        
        The following lifecycle methods are called during normal operations and alternate
        implementations can be provided if needed to perform specialized setup or cleanup.
        
        `on_acquire(self, connection)` - no-op
        
        `on_return(self, connection)` - default implementation calls `connection.rollback()`
        
        `on_close(self, connection)` - default implementation calls `connection.close()`
        
        For example, to implement auto-commit:
        
        ```python
        pool = ...
        pool.on_return = lambda x: x.commit()
        ```
