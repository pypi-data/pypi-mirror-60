        ## Installation
        `gux` is written in Python3 and uses pip3 for installation.
        
        ```bash
        pip3 intall gux
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        `gux` has the following commands: 'use', 'add', 'list', 'ls', 'rm'.
        
        `gux use [user]` - Changes the main tracked user used by `gux`
        `gux rm [user]`  - Deletes a user from the `gux` registry
        `gux add`        - Adds a new user to the `gux` registry
        `gux list`       - Lists the current git configurations in a repo
        `gux ls`         - Show list of current users registered to gux
        
        ## Development
        Use `pipenv` to isolate your development environment. Run the following from the project root:
        
        ```bash
        pipenv shell --python=`which python3`
        ```
        
        In your `pipenv` environment, install `gux` manaully:
        
        Note: Replace the X with the current gux verion.
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall dist/gux-0.0.X-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        To upload the app to pypi:
        
        ```bash
        python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && python3 -m twine upload dist/*
        ```
