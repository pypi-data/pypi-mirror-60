htmltextconvert: HTML to plain text converter
=============================================

htmltextconvert renders HTML to plain text, for example to autogenerate a plain
text versions of HTML emails, or to index HTML documents for search.

It differs from other packages in these ways:

- Pure Python, no dependencies
- High quality, well tested code
- Permissive license (Apache)
- Renders the HTML to text suitable for an text/plain email body (doesn't
  convert to a structured text format such as markdown).


Usage::

    >>> import htmltextconvert
    >>> print(
    ...     htmltextconvert.html_to_text(
    ...         """
    ...         <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    ...         <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
    ...         """
    ...     )
    ... )
    This is a paragraph

    This is another paragraph
