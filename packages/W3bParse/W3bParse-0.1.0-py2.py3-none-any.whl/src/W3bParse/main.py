# This file is a demonstration of my replit module fix. To use it in your own python repls, just add a file called replit.py and copy in the code from the replit.py file here. You then shouldn't need to change the rest of your code at all.

import time, replit

print('Not cleared')

time.sleep(1)

replit.clear()
print('Cleared')
