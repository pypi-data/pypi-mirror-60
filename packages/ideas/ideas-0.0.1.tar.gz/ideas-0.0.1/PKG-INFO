Description: # ideas
        Easy creation of custom import hooks to try out new ideas for Python.
        
        [Documentation](https://aroberge.github.io/ideas/docs/html/)
        
        ## Original motivation
        
        Programming in Python is my main hobby. I like to explore various
        ideas, learning along the way.
        As I find myself doing a lot of copy/paste/modify on the various import
        hooks experiments, including on some published projects such as
        [AvantPy](https://aroberge.github.io/avantpy/docs/html/),
        I thought it would make sense to create a versatile projects which I could
        use as the basis of other projects.  An obvious benefit is that I will
        need to fix bugs in a single project.
        
        ### Additional motivation
        
        Often, on python-ideas, a suggestion is made to someone that proposes something
        new to try it by modifying Python using an import hook.
        I have yet to see a case of someone following up on such suggestions.
        I believe that the main reason is that most people do not know how to
        do this.
        
        So, by creating this project, I'm hoping that enough examples will
        be created that could be easily adapted for exploring proposals
        submitted to python-ideas. If that is the case, I will likely benefit
        too as advanced Python programmers may make suggestions as to how
        to improve this project.
        
        ## About the name
        
        For this project, I was thinking of using `importhook` (singular) or
        `importhooks` (plural). However, there is already a project named
        `importhook` on Pypi and I thought that using the plural form would
        likely be just too confusing.
        
        I settled on `ideas` as I am guessing that the main application would be
        for people to try out suggestions from or for python-ideas.
        
        ## Tools
        
        This project uses black for formatting, pytest for running tests,
        and flake8 for linting.
        
        
        ## To Do
        
        - Add requirements-dev.txt file
        - Add setup.py file and upload to pypi
        - List cases/recipes to be included
        - Add console
        - Add docs
        - Add support for `__main__`
        - Add test to ensure desired paths (e.g. Python standard library) are excluded.
        - show excluded path
        - show abbreviations used for paths
        - always exclude ideas itself
