Description: 
        This is the simplest wrapper possible for the partial-tracking library Loris.
        The source of the library is included as part of the project --there is no need
        to install the library independently.
        
        The main goal was as an analysis tool for the package `sndtrck`, which
        implements an agnostic data structure to handle partial tracking information
