    Return the union of the two sets of wavelengths using
    :func:`numpy.union1d`.  This is cribbed from astropy.synphot.utils;
    the original version was in astrolib pysynphot.spectrum.MergeWavesets.

    The merged wavelengths may sometimes contain numbers which are nearly
    equal but differ at levels as small as 1e-14. Having values this
    close together can cause problems down the line. So, here we test
    whether any such small differences are present, with a small
    difference defined as less than ``threshold``. If a small
    difference is present, the lower of the too-close pair is removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waveset1, waveset2 : array_like
        Wavelength values, assumed to be in the same unit already.

    threshold : float, optional
        Merged wavelength values are considered "too close together"
        when the difference is smaller than this number.
        The default is 1e-12.
