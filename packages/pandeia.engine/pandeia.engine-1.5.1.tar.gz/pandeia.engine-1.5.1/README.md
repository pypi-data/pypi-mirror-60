The Pandeia engine is a 'simulation-hybrid' exposure time calculation engine that performs calculations on two-dimensional astronomical scenes created by the user. It uses a pixel-based 3D approach, modeling both the spatial and wavelength dimensions using realistic PSFs for each instrument mode, and handles saturation, correlated read noise, and inter-pixel capacitance.

Installation and setup instructions (including a required data package) for the Pandeia engine can be found at this Space Telescope Science Institute page: https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-exposure-time-calculator-overview/jwst-etc-pandeia-engine-tutorial/installing-pandeia

Usage guides for the Pandeia engine can be found here: https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-exposure-time-calculator-overview/jwst-etc-pandeia-engine-tutorial
