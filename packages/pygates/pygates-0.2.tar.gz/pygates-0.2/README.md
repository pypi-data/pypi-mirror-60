# **PyGates**


PyGates is a library for using the logic gates as a conditions on Python.


#### Installation
____________________

PyGates can be installed using:

```sh
pip install pygates
```

Or if you have multiple versions of Python and pip on your machine, try:

```sh
pip3 install pygates
```

Alternatively, you can pull the library directly from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Baticaly/PyGates
cd PyGates
python setup.py install
```

#### Usage
____________________

You can just basicaly use the gates as a condition like:

    PyGates.Gates.AND('input1', 'input2')

Or just for calling the functions easily you can create a basic definition for library:


    import pygates
    lg = pygates.Gates

And you can easily call it by using:


    lg.AND('input1', 'input2')

| Gate | Function | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| AND | ```PyGates.Gates.AND( 'A' , 'B' )``` | 
| NAND | ```PyGates.Gates.NAND( 'A' , 'B' )``` | 
| OR | ```PyGates.Gates.OR( 'A' , 'B' )``` |  
| NOR | ```PyGates.Gates.NOR( 'A' , 'B' )``` |
| XOR | ```PyGates.Gates.XOR( 'A' , 'B' )``` | 
| XNOR | ```PyGates.Gates.XNOR( 'A' , 'B' )``` |
