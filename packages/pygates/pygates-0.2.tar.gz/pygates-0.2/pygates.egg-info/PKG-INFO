Description: # **PyGates**
        
        
        PyGates is a library for using the logic gates as a conditions on Python.
        
        
        #### Installation
        ____________________
        
        PyGates can be installed using:
        
        ```sh
        pip install pygates
        ```
        
        Or if you have multiple versions of Python and pip on your machine, try:
        
        ```sh
        pip3 install pygates
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can pull the library directly from GitHub:
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Baticaly/PyGates
        cd PyGates
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        #### Usage
        ____________________
        
        You can just basicaly use the gates as a condition like:
        
            PyGates.Gates.AND('input1', 'input2')
        
        Or just for calling the functions easily you can create a basic definition for library:
        
        
            import pygates
            lg = pygates.Gates
        
        And you can easily call it by using:
        
        
            lg.AND('input1', 'input2')

        | Gate | Function | 
        | ------ | ------ | 
        | AND | ```PyGates.Gates.AND( 'A' , 'B' )``` | 
        | NAND | ```PyGates.Gates.NAND( 'A' , 'B' )``` | 
        | OR | ```PyGates.Gates.OR( 'A' , 'B' )``` |  
        | NOR | ```PyGates.Gates.NOR( 'A' , 'B' )``` |
        | XOR | ```PyGates.Gates.XOR( 'A' , 'B' )``` | 
        | XNOR | ```PyGates.Gates.XNOR( 'A' , 'B' )``` |
