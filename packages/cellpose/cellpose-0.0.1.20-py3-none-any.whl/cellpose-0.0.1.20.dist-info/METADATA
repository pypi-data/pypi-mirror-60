# Cellpose <img src="cellpose/logo/logo.png" width="250" title="cellpose" alt="cellpose" align="right" vspace = "50">

A generalist algorithm for cell and nucleus segmentation. 

This code was written by Carsen Stringer and Marius Pachitariu. To learn about Cellpose, read the [paper](https://t.co/4HFsxDezAP?amp=1) or watch the [talk](https://t.co/JChCsTD0SK?amp=1). For support, please open an [issue](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose/issues). 

You can quickly try out Cellpose on the [website](http://www.cellpose.org) first (some features disabled). If you want to improve Cellpose for yourself and for everyone else, please consider contributing manual segmentations for a few of your images via the built-in GUI interface. 

## Installation

We recommend installing an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python -- Choose **Python 3.7** and your operating system. Note you might need to use an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path. From your base environment (or you can make a new environment) in an anaconda prompt/command prompt, run
~~~~
pip install cellpose
~~~~

Alternatively you can use the included environment file (if you'd like a cellpose-specific environment). This is **recommended** if you have problems with the pip. Please follow these instructions:

1. Download the [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose/blob/master/environment.yml) file from the repository. You can do this by cloning the repository, or copy-pasting the text from the file into a text document on your local computer.
2. Open an anaconda prompt / command prompt with `conda` for **python 3** in the path
3. Change directories to where the `environment.yml` is and run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. To activate this new environment, run `conda activate cellpose`
5. You should see `(cellpose)` on the left side of the terminal line. Now run `python -m cellpose` and you're all set.

If you have an older `cellpose` environment you can remove it with `conda env remove -n cellpose` before creating a new one.

Note you will always have to run **conda activate cellpose** before you run cellpose. If you want to run jupyter notebooks in this environment, then also `conda install jupyter`.

To upgrade cellpose (package [here](https://pypi.org/project/cellpose/)), run the following in the environment:
~~~~
pip install cellpose --upgrade
~~~~

**Common issues**

If you receive the error: `Illegal instruction (core dumped)`, then likely mxnet does not recognize your MKL version. Please uninstall and reinstall mxnet without mkl:
~~~~
pip uninstall mxnet-mkl
pip uninstall mxnet
pip install mxnet==1.4.0
~~~~

If you receive the error: `No module named PyQt5.sip`, then try uninstalling and reinstalling pyqt5
~~~~
pip uninstall pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools pyqt5.sip
~~~~

If you receive an error associated with **matplotlib**, try upgrading it:
~~~~
pip install matplotlib --upgrade
~~~~

If you are on Yosemite Mac OS, PyQt doesn't work and you won't be able to use the graphical interface for cellpose. More recent versions of Mac OS are fine. The software has been heavily tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04, and less well tested on Mac OS. Please post an issue if you have installation problems.

**CUDA version**

If you plan on running many images, you may want to install a GPU version of *mxnet*. Follow the instructions [here](https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started?).

Before installing the GPU version, remove the CPU version:
~~~
pip uninstall mxnet-mkl
pip uninstall mxnet
~~~

**Installation of github version**

Follow steps from above to install the dependencies. In the github repository, run `pip install -e .` and the github version will be installed. If you want to go back to the pip version of cellpose, then say `pip install cellpose`.

## Running cellpose

The quickest way to start is to open the GUI from a command line terminal. You might need to open an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path:
~~~~
python -m cellpose
~~~~

The first time cellpose runs it downloads the latest available trained model weights from the website.

You can now **drag and drop** any images (*.tif, *.png, *.jpg, *.gif) into the GUI and run Cellpose, and/or manually segment them. When the GUI is processing, you will see the progress bar fill up and during this time you cannot click on anything in the GUI. For more information about what the GUI is doing you can look at the terminal/prompt you opened the GUI with. For example data, See [website](http://www.cellpose.org). For best accuracy and runtime performance, resize images so cells are less than 100 pixels across. 

For multi-channel, multi-Z tiff's, the expected format is Z x channels x Ly x Lx.

**In the GUI**

The GUI serves two main functions:

1. Running the segmentation algorithm.
2. Manually labelling data.

Main GUI mouse controls (works in all views):

- Pan  = left-click  + drag  
- Zoom = scroll wheel
- Full view = double left-click
- Select mask = left-click on mask
- Delete mask = Ctrl + left-click
- Start draw mask = right-click
- End draw mask = right-click, or return to circle at beginning

Overlaps in masks are NOT allowed. If you draw a mask on top of another mask, it is cropped so that it doesn't overlap with the old mask. Masks in 2D should be single strokes (if single stroke is checked). 

!NOTE!: The GUI automatically saves after you draw a mask but NOT after segmentation. Save in the file menu or with Ctrl+S. The output file is in the same folder as the loaded image with `_seg.npy` appended.

| CTRL+Z              | undo previously drawn mask/stroke                              |
| CTRL+0              | clear all masks                                                |
| CTRL+L              | load image (can alternatively drag and drop image)             |
| CTRL+S              | SAVE MASKS IN IMAGE to `_seg.npy` file                      |
| CTRL+P              | load `_seg.npy` file (note: it will load automatically with image if it exists) |
| CTRL+M              | load masks file (must be same size as image with 0 for NO mask, and 1,2,3... for masks)|
| CTRL+N              | load numpy stack (NOT WORKING ATM)                             |
| A/D or LEFT/RIGHT   | cycle through images in current directory                      |
| W/S or UP/DOWN      | change color (RGB/gray/red/green/blue)                         |
| PAGE-UP / PAGE-DOWN | change to flows and cell prob views (if segmentation computed) |
| , / .               | increase / decrease brush size for drawing masks               |
| X                   | turn masks ON or OFF                                           |
| Z                   | toggle outlines ON or OFF                                      |
| C                   | cycle through labels for image type (saved to `_seg.npy`)   |

**Segmentation options**

SIZE: you can manually enter the approximate diameter for your cells, or press "calibrate" to let the model estimate it. The size is represented by a disk at the bottom of the view window (can turn this disk off by unchecking "scale disk on").

use GPU: if you have installed the cuda version of mxnet, then you can activate this, but it won't give huge speedups when running single images in the GUI.

MODEL: there is a *cytoplasm* model and a *nuclei* model, choose what you want to segment

CHAN TO SEG: this is the channel in which the cytoplasm or nuclei exist

CHAN2 (OPT): if *cytoplasm* model is chosen, then choose the nuclear channel for this option

imgs = [plt.imread(f) for f in files]
nimg = len(imgs)

# define CHANNELS to run segementation on
# grayscale=0, R=1, G=2, B=3
# channels = [cytoplasm, nucleus]
# if NUCLEUS channel does not exist, set the second channel to 0
channels = [[2,3], [0,0]]

# if rescale is set to None, the size of the cells is estimated on a per image basis
# if you want to set the size yourself, set it to 30. / average_cell_diameter
masks, flows, styles, diams = model.eval(imgs, rescale=None, channels=channels)
