# ABOUT RANK PREDICTOR


It is a method of compensatory aggregation that compares a set of alternatives 
by identifying weights for each criterion, normalising scores for each criterion and 
calculating the geometric distance between each alternative and the ideal alternative, 
which is the best score in each criterion.
