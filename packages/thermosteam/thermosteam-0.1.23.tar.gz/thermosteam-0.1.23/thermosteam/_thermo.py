class Thermo:
    """Create a Thermo object that defines a thermodynamic property package
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    chemicals : Chemicals or Iterable[str]
        Pure component chemical data.
    mixture : Mixture
        Calculator for mixture properties.
    Gamma : ActivityCoefficients subclass
        Class for computing activity coefficiente.
    Phi : FugacityCoefficients subclass
        Class for computing fugacity coefficiente.
    PCF : PoyntingCorrectionFactor subclass.
        Class for computing poynting correction factors.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from thermosteam import Thermo, Chemicals
    >>> chemicals = Chemicals(['Ethanol', 'Water'])
    >>> Thermo(chemicals)
    Thermo(chemicals=CompiledChemicals([Ethanol, Water]), mixture=IdealMixture(...), Gamma=DortmundActivityCoefficients, Phi=IdealFugacityCoefficients, PCF=IdealPoyintingCorrectionFactors)
    
    Note how chemicals are compiled when it becomes part of a Thermo object.
