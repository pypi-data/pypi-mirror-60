Description: # sphinxcontrib-remoteliteralinclude
        Sphinx extension that extends the ``literalinclude`` directive to allow remote URLS
        
        ## Installation
        
        ``python3 -m pip install sphinxcontrib-remoteliteralinclude``
        
        ## Usage
        
        Simply just use it as you normally would a normal ``literalinclude``
        
        ```
        .. remoteliteralinclude:: https://example.com/example.java
           :language: java
           :lines: 10-29
           :linenos:
           :lineno-start: 10
        ```
        
        ## Important Notes
        
        This is simply a modification of the normal literalinclude extension. Near all of the code is the exact same. Modifications are made by Eli Barnett, with pip module creation by Dalton Smith. 
        
        Using the extension to reference local files **will not** work. Use the regular ``literalinclude`` extension in that case.
