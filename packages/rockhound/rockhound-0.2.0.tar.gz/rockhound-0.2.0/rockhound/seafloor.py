    """
    Fetch the age of the oceanic lithosphere global grid

    Grids produced by [Muller2008]_.

    Includes the age uncertainty grid as well. Both are available in 2 and
    6 arc-minute resolutions. The units for the ages are millions of years. The
    grids span longitudes from 0 E to 360 E and latitudes from 90 N to -90
    N and are grid-line registered.

    If the files aren't already in your data directory, they will be downloaded
    automatically.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolution : str
        Which resolution grid to load. Must be ``"6min"`` or ``"2min"``.
    load : bool
        Whether to load the data into an :class:`xarray.Dataset` or just return
        the path to the downloaded data. If False, will return a list with the
        paths to the age and age uncertainty grids, respectively.
    kwargs
        Keyword arguments will be forwarded to the :func:`xarray.open_dataset`
        function that loads the grid into memory.

    Returns
    -------
    grid : :class:`xarray.Dataset` or str
        The loaded grid or the file path to the downloaded data.
