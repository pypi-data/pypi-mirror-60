Description: # OXASL_MULTITE
        
        Plugin for the OXASL pipeline to support multi-TE ASL data.
        
        The data is optionally initially fitted to the standard resting state
        ASL model and then the fitted perfusion/arrival time data is used to initialize
        the multi-TE model to fit the exchange time.
