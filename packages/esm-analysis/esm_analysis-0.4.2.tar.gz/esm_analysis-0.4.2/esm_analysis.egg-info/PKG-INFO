        Analysis Scripts for ESM Simulations
        
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        ``esm_analysis`` is the sugar for your bitter CDO-coffee. Check it out:
        
        Install ``esm_analysis`` with::
        
            pip install esm_analysis
        
        Go to an experiment::
        
            cd /work/ba0989/a270077/AWICM_PISM/LGM_011
        
        Get a climatology::
        
            esm_analysis newest-climatology temp2
            esm_analysis newest-climatology thetao
        
        Calculate AMOC::
        
            esm_analysis amoc
        
        Isn't that better than this?
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            outdata_dir=... # oh man now I need to figure out where the outdata is
            expid=PI # ...uh...PI, I guess?...
            outfile=test.nc # ...I guess I should think of a real name for my output
            vars=temp2 # Oh! I know that one!
            filepattern="echam6_echam"
            fileext=".nc" # Aww geez I have no idea. Is it nc? grb? Let's just guess...
            # How did cdo work again?
            cdo -h select
            cdo -h timmmean
            # Ok, now I think I know what I want:
            cdo -f nc -t echam6 -timmean -select,name=$vars ${outdata_dir}/${expid}_${filepattern}${fileext} $outfile
        
        I'd support the following hypothesis: you clearly don't want to type all that stuff
        out. Just say what you want. Easy, right?
        
        The computer should be able to figure out the rest for you. If Google can
        predict where I get my breakfast, why can't my computer figure out what ``CDO``
        command I want to use??
