# This is the blacklist file. Each package listed here may not be
# installed be upgraded be find or deleted.
# NOTE: The settings here affect all repositories.
#
# To blacklist the package 'wicd-1.7.2.4-x86_64-4.txz' the line will be:
# wicd
#
# This one will blacklist all packages include string "lib" in package name:
# *lib*
#
# Add packages in blacklist by repository:
# slacky:*       `add all packages from the slacky repository`
# sbo:py*        `add all packages from the sbo starts with 'py'`
# sbo:jdk        `add jdk package from the sbo repository`
# slack:*multi*  `add packages include string 'multi' from the slack`
# msb:*.txz      `add packages ends with '.txz' from the msb repository`
#
# Sometimes the automatic kernel update creates problems because you
# may need to file intervention 'lilo'. The slpkg automatically detects
# if the core has been upgraded and running 'lilo'. If you want to avoid
# any problems uncomment the lines below.
