0.9.1
-----

Changed
~~~~~~~

  pretty-prints AssertionErrors generated by `assert` statements

-----

Fixed
~~~~~

  be used together. Thanks @fajpunk.
* Fixed incorrect calling order of layer setup/teardown and test
  setup/test teardown methods. Thanks again @fajpunk for tests and fixes.

0.4.4
-----

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fixed sort key generation for layers.

0.4.3
-----

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fixed packaging for non-setuptools, pre-python 2.7. Thanks to fajpunk
  for the patch.

0.4.2
-----

Added
~~~~~

* Added ``uses`` method to ``such.Scenario`` to allow use of externally-defined
  layers in such DSL tests.

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fixed unpredictable ordering of layer tests.

0.4.1
-----

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fixed packaging bug.

0.4
---

Added
~~~~~

* nose2.plugins.layers to support Zope testing style fixture layers.
* nose2.tools.such, a spec-like DSL for writing tests with layers.
* nose2.plugins.loader.loadtests to support the unittest2 load_tests protocol.

0.3
---

Added
~~~~~

* nose2.plugins.mp to support distributing test runs across multiple processes.
* nose2.plugins.testclasses to support loading tests from ordinary classes that
  are not subclasses of unittest.TestCase.
* ``nose2.main.PluggableTestProgram`` now accepts an ``extraHooks`` keyword
  argument, which allows attaching arbitrary objects to the hooks system.

Changed
~~~~~~~

* The default script target was changed from ``nose2.main`` to ``nose2.discover``.
  The former may still be used for running a single module of tests,
  unittest-style. The latter ignores the ``module`` argument. Thanks to
  @dtcaciuc for the bug report (#32).

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fixed bug that caused Skip reason to always be set to ``None``.

0.2
---

Added
~~~~~

* nose2.plugins.junitxml to support jUnit XML output
* nose2.plugins.attrib to support test filtering by attributes

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Added afterTestRun hook and moved result report output calls
  to that hook. This prevents plugin ordering issues with the
  stopTestRun hook (which still exists, and fires before
  afterTestRun).

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fixed bug in loading of tests by name that caused ImportErrors
  to be silently ignored.
* Fixed missing __unittest flag in several modules. Thanks to
  Wouter Overmeire for the patch.
* Fixed module fixture calls for function, generator and param tests.
* Fixed passing of command-line argument values to list
  options. Before this fix, lists of lists would be appended to the
  option target. Now, the option target list is extended with the new
  values. Thanks to memedough for the bug report.
