### 1. Introduction


> "plural personae : a character in a fictional presentation (such as a novel or play) —usually used in plural" 

> “Persona.” The Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Inc., https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/personae.

With no offense given towards players who may prefer such a play style, ***personaednd*** attempts to generate characters according to a "role player" perspective and not from a "roll player" perspective.

###### Customization

This file can be modified to include additional content by following the defined format.
