### Sample Results

### Overview
PyTorch implementation for CRAFT text detector that effectively detect text area by exploring each character region and affinity between characters. The bounding box of texts are obtained by simply finding minimum bounding rectangles on binary map after thresholding character region and affinity scores.

## Updates
**13 Jun, 2019**: Initial update
**20 Jul, 2019**: Added post-processing for polygon result
**28 Sep, 2019**: Added the trained model on IC15 and the link refiner
**25 Jan, 2020**: Put it together as a PyPI package


## Getting started

### Use it straight from PyPI
#### Installation
```
pip install craft-text-detection
```
#### Usage
```
import craft
import cv2
img = cv2.imread('/path/to/image/file')

# run the detector
bboxes, polys, heatmap = craft.detect_text(img)

# view the image with bounding boxes
img_boxed = craft.show_bounding_boxes(img, bboxes)
cv2.imshow('fig', img_boxed)

# view detection heatmap
cv2.imshow('fig', heatmap)
```

### Use from source - install dependencies
#### Requirements
- PyTorch>=0.4.1
- torchvision>=0.2.1
- opencv-python>=3.4.2
- check requiremetns.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training
The code for training is not included in this repository, and we cannot release the full training code for IP reason.


### Arguments for detect_text
* `--text_threshold`: text confidence threshold
* `--low_text`: text low-bound score
* `--link_threshold`: link confidence threshold
* `--canvas_size`: max image size for inference
* `--mag_ratio`: image magnification ratio
* `--refine`: use link refiner for sentence-level dataset
* `--refiner_model`: pretrained refiner model
