# h-matchers

Test objects which pass equality checks with other objects

Usage
-----

```python
from h_matchers import Any
import re

assert [1, 2, ValueError(), print, print] == [
        Any(),
        Any.int(),
        Any.instance_of(ValueError),
        Any.function(),
        Any.callable()
    ]

assert ["easy", "string", "matching"] == [
        Any.string(),
        Any.string.containing("in"),
        Any.string.matching('^.*CHING!', re.IGNORECASE)
    ]
```

### Comparing to collections
You can make basic comparisons to collections as follows:

```python
Any.iterable()
Any.list()
Any.set()
```

You can specify a custom class with:

```python
Any.iterable.of_type(MyCustomList)
```

#### Specifying size

You can also chain on to add requirements for the size.

```python
Any.iterable.of_size(4)
Any.list.of_size(at_least=3)
Any.set.of_size(at_most=5)
Any.set.of_size(at_least=3, at_most=5)
```

#### Specifying specific content

You can require an iterable to have a minimum number of items, with repetitions
, optionally in order:

```python
Any.iterable.containing([1])
Any.list.containing([1, 2, 2])
Any.list.containing([1, 2, 2]).in_order()
```

This will match if the sequence is found any where in the iterable.

You can also say that there cannot be any extra items in the iterable:

```python
Any.set.containing({2, 3, 4}).only()
Any.list.containing([1, 2, 2, 3]).only().in_order()
```

All of this should work with non-hashable items too as long as the items test
as equal:

```python
Any.set.containing([{'a': 1}, {'b': 2}])
```

#### Specifying every item must match something

You can specify that every item in the collection must match a certain item.
You can also pass matchers to this:

```python
Any.list.comprised_of(Any.string).of_size(6)
Any.iterable.comprised_of(True)
```

### Comparing to dicts

Basic comparisons are available:

```python
Any.iterable()
Any.mapping()
Any.dict()
```

### Most things for collections go for dicts too

```python
Any.dict.of_size(at_most=4)
Any.dict.containing(['key_1', 'key_2']).only()
```

### You can test for key value pairs

```python
Any.dict.containing({'a': 5, 'b': 6})
Any.dict.containing({'a': 5, 'b': 6}).only()
```

### You can compare against any mappable including multi-value dicts

This is useful for dict-like objects which may have different behavior and
semantics to regular dicts. For example: objects which support multiple values
for the same key.

```python
Any.mapping.containing(MultiDict(['a', 1], ['a', 2]))
```

Hacking
-------

### Installing h-matchers in a development environment

#### You will need

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
  Follow the instructions in the pyenv README to install it.
  The Homebrew method works best on macOS.
  On Ubuntu follow the Basic GitHub Checkout method.

#### Clone the git repo

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/hypothesis/h-matchers.git
```

This will download the code into a `h-matchers` directory
in your current working directory. You need to be in the
`h-matchers` directory for the rest of the installation
process:

```terminal
cd h-matchers
```

#### Run the tests

```terminal
make test
```

**That's it!** You’ve finished setting up your h-matchers
development environment. Run `make help` to see all the commands that're
available for linting, code formatting, packaging, etc.

### Updating the Cookiecutter scaffolding

This project was created from the
https://github.com/hypothesis/h-cookiecutter-pypackage/ template.
If h-cookiecutter-pypackage itself has changed since this project was created, and
you want to update this project with the latest changes, you can "replay" the
cookiecutter over this project. Run:

```terminal
make template
```

**This will change the files in your working tree**, applying the latest
updates from the h-cookiecutter-pypackage template. Inspect and test the
changes, do any fixups that are needed, and then commit them to git and send a
pull request.

If you want `make template` to skip certain files, never changing them, add
these files to `"options.disable_replay"` in
[`.cookiecutter.json`](.cookiecutter.json) and commit that to git.

If you want `make template` to update a file that's listed in `disable_replay`
simply delete that file and then run `make template`, it'll recreate the file
for you.
