# Sprite-sheet-kyquanlx
In computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene, most often in a 2D video game. Sprites were developed at Texas Instruments by Daniel Hillis.

A sprite sheet is an image that consists of several smaller images (sprites) and/or animations. Combining the small images in one big image improves the game performance, reduces the memory usage and speeds up the startup time of the game.

This project will create a SpriteSheet class and will find all sprite in object image.
