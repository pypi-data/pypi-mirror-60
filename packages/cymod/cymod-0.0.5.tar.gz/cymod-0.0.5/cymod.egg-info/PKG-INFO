Description: 
        ============================================================
        Cymod
        ============================================================
        
        A tool to support the description and development of state-and-transition 
        models using the Cypher_ graph query language.
        
        Purpose
        -------
        
        State-and-transition models (STMs_) are valuable tools for capturing and 
        communicating qualitative ecological and geomorphic knowledge. However, 
        they can become unwieldy when the richness of the available qualitative 
        knowledge renders them difficult to represent in their entirety on a 
        2-dimensional surface.
        
        Cymod aims to simplify the development and use of detailed STMs by allowing
        modellers to specify components of their models piecemeal in individual Cypher
        files. Cymod can then to do the work of wiring these components together into a
        complete model, stored in a Neo4j_ graph database.
        
        Example usage
        -------------
        
        Having prepared a set of Cypher files specifying an STM in the
        ``./cypher-files`` directory, a modeller can load those files into the graph
        database with the following Python commands:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           from cymod import ServerGraphLoader
        
           # Initialise a ServerGraphLoader object using your Neo4j credentials
           gl = ServerGraphLoader(user="username", password="password")
        
           # Read cypher queries from files in cypher-files directory
           gl.load_cypher("cypher-files")
        
           # Run these queries against the graph specified in the neo4j
           # configuration file
           gl.commit()
