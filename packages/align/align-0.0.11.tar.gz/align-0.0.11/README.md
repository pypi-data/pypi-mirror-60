# ALIGN, a computational tool for multi-level language analysis (optimized for Python 3)

`align` is a Python library for extracting quantitative, reproducible
metrics of multi-level alignment between two speakers in naturalistic
language corpora. The method was introduced in "ALIGN: Analyzing
Linguistic Interactions with Generalizable techNiques" (Duran, Paxton, &
Fusaroli, 2019; Psychological Methods).

## Try out `align` with Binder

Interested in seeing how `align` works, but not sure if you want to install it
yet? Try it out through Binder. Click the "launch" button to get a complete
cloud environment to try out the ALIGN pipeline on our Python tutorials (the CHILDES
  tutorial is currently the only one fully operational). The process for Binder to launch may
  take several minutes.

## Installation

`align` may downloaded directly using `pip`.

To download the stable version released on PyPI:
```
pip install align
```

To download directly from our GitHub repo:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/nickduran/align-linguistic-alignment.git
```

## Additional tools required for some `align` options

The Google News pre-trained word2vec vectors (`GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin`)
and the Stanford part-of-speech tagger (`stanford-postagger-full-2018-10-16`)
are required for some optional `align` parameters but must be downloaded
separately.

## Tutorials

We created Jupyter Notebook tutorials to provide an easily accessible
step-by-step walkthrough on how to use `align`. Below are descriptions of the
current tutorials that can be found in the `examples` directory within this
repository. If unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, instructions for installing
and running can be found here: http://jupyter.org/install. We recommend installing
Jupyter using Anaconda. Anaconda is a widely-used Python data science platform
that helps streamline workflows. A major advantage is that Anaconda also makes it easy
to set up unique Python environments - which may be necessary to run `align`
and the tutorials given `align` is currently optimized for Python 3.

* **Jupyter Notebook 1: CHILDES**
    * This tutorial walks users through an analysis of conversations from a
      single English corpus from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney,
      2000)---specifically, Kuczaj’s Abe corpus (Kuczaj, 1976). We analyze the
      last 20 conversations in the corpus in order to explore how ALIGN can be
      used to track multi-level linguistic alignment between a parent and child
      over time, which may be of interest to developmental language researchers.
      Specifically, we explore how alignment between a parent and a child
      changes over a brief span of developmental trajectory.

* **Jupyter Notebook 2: Devil's Advocate**
    * This tutorial walks users throught the analysis reported in (Duran,
      Paxton, & Fusaroli, 2019). The corpus consists of 94 written
      transcripts of conversations, lasting eight minutes each, collected from
      an experimental study of truthful and deceptive communication. The goal
      of the study was to examine interpersonal linguistic alignment between
      dyads across two conversations where participants either agreed or
      disagreed with each other (as a randomly assigned between-dyads condition)
      and where one of the conversations involved the truth and the other
      deception (as a within-subjects condition).

We are in the process of adding more tutorials and would welcome additional
tutorials by interested contributors.
