        QR3
        =====
        
        **QR3** helps you create and work with **queue, capped collection (bounded queue),
        deque, and stack** data structures for **Redis**. Redis is well-suited for
        implementations of these abstract data structures, and QR3 makes it even easier to
        work with the structures in Python.
        
        Quick Setup
        ------------
        You'll need [Redis](http://github.com/antirez/redis/ "Redis") itself (QR makes use 
        of MULTI/EXEC, so you'll need the Git edge version), and the current Python interface
        for Redis, [redis-py](http://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py "redis-py"). 
        
        Run setup.py to install qr3 or 'pip install qr3'.
        
        Responding to PR's
        ------------------
        Given that this package primarily supports internal use cases, we cannot guarantee a 
        specific response time on PRs for new features. However, we will do our best to 
        consider them in a timely fashion.
        
        We do commit to reviewing anything related to a security issue in a timely manner. 
        We ask that you first submit anything of that nature to security@doctorondemand.com 
        prior to creating a PR and follow responsible disclosure rules.
