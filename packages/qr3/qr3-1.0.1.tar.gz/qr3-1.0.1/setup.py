QR3
=====

**QR3** helps you create and work with **queue, capped collection (bounded queue),
deque, and stack** data structures for **Redis**. Redis is well-suited for
implementations of these abstract data structures, and QR3 makes it even easier to
work with the structures in Python.

Quick Setup
------------
You'll need [Redis](http://github.com/antirez/redis/ "Redis") itself (QR makes use 
of MULTI/EXEC, so you'll need the Git edge version), and the current Python interface
for Redis, [redis-py](http://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py "redis-py"). 

Run setup.py to install qr3 or 'pip install qr3'.

Responding to PR's
------------------
Given that this package primarily supports internal use cases, we cannot guarantee a 
specific response time on PRs for new features. However, we will do our best to 
consider them in a timely fashion.

We do commit to reviewing anything related to a security issue in a timely manner. 
We ask that you first submit anything of that nature to security@doctorondemand.com 
prior to creating a PR and follow responsible disclosure rules.

Thanks for your interest in helping with this package!
