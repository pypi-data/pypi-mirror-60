Description: # csg2csg
        A tool to translate common Monte Carlo geometry formats between each other.
        
        ## How to use
        Right now the code is petty rough; as is the install procedure.
        
        Install using pip
        ``pip3 install csg2csg --user``
        
        Run csg2csg.py -i filename
        
        ## Caveats
        Several! Right now only MCNP can be read, and then written to MCNP Serpent and OpenMC. 
        When the file can be read only a subset of MCNP surfaces can be read
        
        MCNP Surfaces Supported
         - P,PX,PY,PZ
         - S SO SX  SY SZ
         - CX CY CZ C/X C/Y C/Z
         - SQ
         - GQ
         - KX, KY, KZ
         - TX TY TZ
         - Macrobodies - RPP, SPH and RCC 
         - X, Y, Z - one and two coefficent only
        
        
        MCNP Surfaces Not Yet Supported
         - X, Y, Z - three coefficient
         - Macrobodies - BOX, RHP, HEX, REC, TRC, ELL, WEB, ARB
        
        Tranforms
         - Are read and interpretted, but nothing is done with them, in the future codes that support cell transformations will use it, but right now MCNP is the only code that does surface transformations
