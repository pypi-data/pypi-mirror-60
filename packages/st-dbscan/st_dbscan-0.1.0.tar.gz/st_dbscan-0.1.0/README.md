# ST-DBSCAN

**Simple and effective tool for spatial-temporal clustering**

*st_dbscan* is an open-source software package for the spatial-temporal clustering of movement data:

- Implemnted using `numpy` and `sklearn`
- Enables to also scale to memory - with splitting the data into frames
- __Usage:__ can view a demo of common features in this
[this Jupyter Notebook](/demo/demo.ipynb).

## Installation
The easiest way to install *st_dbscan* is by using `pip` :

    pip install st_dbscan
