# PyProxyRoulette
The pyproxyroulette library is a wrapper for the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library. The wrapper applies a random proxy to each request and ensures that the proxy is working and swaps it out when needed. Additionally, the wrapper tries to detect if a request has been blocked by the requested web-host. Blocked requests are repeated with different proxy servers. The wrapper can be used in multi-threaded applications like crawlers or scrapers. 

## Installation
This library is available on pypi. Hence it can be installed as follows:
```bash
pip install pyproxyroulette
```
## Example Wrapper Usage
```python
from pyproxyroulette import ProxyRoulette
pr = ProxyRoulette()
pr.get("http://github.com")
```
The functions `get`, `post`, `option`, `put`, `delete` and `head` from the requests library are wrapped and callable through the wrapper.
It is generally **only recommended to call and use idempotent methods** as requests which timeout can be registered by the server, despite not beeing registerd in time at the client. Hence it is only recommended to use the `GET` method in production environments.

### Initialisation parameters
```python
pr = ProxyRoulette(debug_mode=False, 
                   max_retries=5,
                   max_timeout=15,
                   func_proxy_validator=defaults.proxy_is_working,
                   func_proxy_response_validator=defaults.proxy_response_validator)
```
| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| debug_mode | False | When activated, it prints additional internal information used for debugging |
| max_retries | 5 | Number of retries with different proxies when a request fails. Set to 0 for unlimited retries. |
| max_timeout | 15 | Timeout until a request is assumed to have failed |
| func_proxy_validator |defaults.proxy_is_working() | Function, that can check if a specific (ip,port) combination is valid and working |
| func_proxy_response_validator | defaults.proxy_response_validator() | Function, which checks if a request has been blocked by inspecting the response. A blocked request will lead to repetition of the request using a different proxy |

## Extend the Pool of Proxies
It is possible to add functions to the system, which are called on a regular basis and return pairs of IP,PORT to be used in the proxy roulette.
A proxy pool update function has to return a list of IP,PORT tuples. A default function is used to populate the proxy pool if no
explicit function is defined. Multiple functions can be added using the following decorator:
```python
from pyproxyroulette import ProxyRoulette

@ProxyRoulette.proxy_pool_updater
def my_cool_proxy_obtaining_function():
    return [("172.0.0.1",80),...]

pr = ProxyRoulette()

pr.get("http://some.url")
```

## Example Decorator Usage
**WARNING: USE THE DECORATOR ONLY FOR SINGLE-THREADED APPLICATIONS**
```python
import requests
from pyproxyroulette import ProxyRoulette
pr = ProxyRoulette()

@pr.proxify()
def foo_bar():
    requests.get("http://github.com")
```

Using the `@pr.proxify()` decorator above the declaration of a function, will apply pyproxyroulette to all requests made by the requests library in that specific function. Instead of the decorator the usual function `pr.get(...)` is also applicable.

When the decorator detects beeing used in multiple threads, it will raise an exception, as that behaviour is dangerous. The exception can be completely disabled by setting `pr.acknowledge_decorator_restrictions = True`. By default the value is set to False.

**WARNING: Use the decorator ONLY when your application uses the requests library in only ONE thread and when the the requests library is referred to as `requests` in the function. Using a different name for the library than 'requests' will prevent the wrapper from applying the proxy to the requests.**
