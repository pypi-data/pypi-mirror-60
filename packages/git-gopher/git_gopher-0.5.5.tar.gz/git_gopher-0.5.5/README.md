# git-gopher

Improving the Git CLI experience with fzf

## What is this?

Rather than needing to remember the exact name of the branch, tag or remote, or the exact syntax of the different git commands needed, **git-gopher** will provide a list to choose from.

By using `fzf` for these lists, finding and choosing which item can be done by fuzzy searching the text.

And unlike the git GUIs out there, **git-gopher** will say exactly what it's doing by displaying the command it will run before the selection is made.

## What is this not?

At present, **git-gopher** is not meant as a comprehensive git solution to include everything you'd ever want to do. Rather, it looks to streamline typical use-cases in a friendly, convenient manner, and allow custom additions to suit personal edge-cases.

## Requirements

The following must be installed

 - Python 3.5+
 - [git](https://github.com/git/git)
 - [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

## Installation

Make sure the basic build tools are installed

```
pip3 install setuptools wheel
```

Then we can install via pip

```
pip3 install git_gopher
```

Also, `$PATH` should contain the pip bin directory. That would look something like this in `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or equivalent

```
PATH="$PATH:~/.local/bin"
```

## Updating

Updating to the latest version is also done via `pip`

```
pip3 install --no-cache-dir --upgrade git-gopher
```

## Usage

**git-gopher** is run from the command line, same as `git`. The commands will be standard git commands, as if running them directly in the current working directory.

### Menu

The `ggo` command with no arguments will bring up a fzf list of all the commands that git-gopher provides, as well as additional standard git commands.

Custom commands can be added to menu by creating `~/ggo-options.dat` with the options listed in it, one per line, with the command, shortcut, and description separated by `|`.

Note: Commands cannot contain 2 consecutive spaces (`git log`: good, `git  log`: bad). The options are formatted into `columns` and the two spaces are how the command column is delimited.

```
git dosomething      | shortcut  | Description of my command
git dosomethingelse  | shortcut2 | Description of my other command
```

### Individual commands

There are several commands added to make use of `fzf` and make interacting with basic git commands faster and easier.

Commands will list out the available branches or tags in `fzf` as a fuzzy searchable menu rather than requiring that they be provided up front.

Run any command or alias by passing it to the `ggo` command

For commands that support multiple selections, use `SHIFT+TAB` to mark each option.

```
ggo [command|alias]
```
