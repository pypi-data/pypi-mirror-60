# KVDiff

Compare two text files by key columns

# Getting Started

Let's say we have two text files maintaining a list of systems with versions.

```
$ cat a.txt
MacOS 10.12
Windows 10
Ubuntu 16
```

```
$ cat b.txt
MacOS 10.14
Windows 10
Manjaro 17
```

To see which systems are new in `b.txt`, deleted in `b.txt`, and version changed in `b.txt`, run `kvdiff -k1 a.txt b.txt` in the terminal:

```
$ kvdiff -k1 a.txt b.txt
* MacOS 10.12
> MacOS 10.14
+ Manjaro 17
- Ubuntu 16
```

KVDiff reports that MacOS has a version change, new system Manjaro with version 17 is added, and Ubuntu is deleted.
