for images passed to it in a list and writes the scores into ispyb database
using ispby API.

There are two requirements for it tow work:

* the images for which the scoring is calculate need to be add to the database table called ispyb.BLSampleImage.


See comments in ticket VMXI-488 for more details.

Once the local database connection is established and the image added
to the database the script can be used as follows:

    import dls_marco_score_ispyb.score as ms

    ['imgae1', 'image2']

    ms.run(crystal_images)
