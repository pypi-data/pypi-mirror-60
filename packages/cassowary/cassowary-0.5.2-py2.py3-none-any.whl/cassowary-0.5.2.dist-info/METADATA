Cassowary
=========

A pure Python implementation of the `Cassowary constraint-solving algorithm`_.
Cassowary is the algorithm that forms the core of the OS X and iOS visual
layout mechanism.

.. _Cassowary constraint-solving algorithm: http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cassowary/

Quickstart
----------

Cassowary is compatible with both Python 2 or Python 3. To install Cassowary
in your virtualenv, run::

    $ pip install cassowary

Then, in your Python code, you can create and solve constraint systems. See
`the documentation`_ for examples of what this looks like in
practice.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for Cassowary can be found on `Read The Docs`_.
