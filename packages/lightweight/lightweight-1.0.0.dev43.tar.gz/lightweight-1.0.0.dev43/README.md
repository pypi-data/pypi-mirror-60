## Installation
Available from [PyPI][pypi]:
```shell
pip install lightweight
```

## Quick Example
```python
from lightweight import Site, markdown, paths, jinja, template, rss, atom, sass


def blog_posts(source):
    post_template = template('posts/_template.html')
    # Use globs to select files. # source = 'posts/**.md'
    return (markdown(path, post_template) for path in paths(source))

def example(url):
    site = Site(url)
    
    # Render an index page from Jinja2 template.
    site.include('index.html', jinja('pages/index.html'))
    
    # Render markdown blog posts.
    [site.include(f'posts/{post.source_path.stem}.html', post) for post in blog_posts('posts/**.md')]
    site.include('posts.html', jinja('pages/posts.html'))
    
    # Syndicate RSS and Atom feeds.
    site.include('posts.atom.xml', atom(site['posts']))
    site.include('posts.rss.xml', rss(site['posts']))
    
    # Render SASS to CSS.
    site.include('css/style.css', sass('styles/style.scss'))
    
    # Include a copy of a directory.
    site.include('img')
    site.include('js')
    
    return site   

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create a site and generate by writing all of itâ€™s content. 
    example(url='https://example.org/').generate()
```

## Create a new project

Initialize a new project using `init` command:
```bash
lw init <location>
```

It accepts multiple optional arguments:
```
lw init -h
usage: lw.py init [-h] [--url URL] [--title TITLE] [--authors AUTHORS]
                  location

Generate Lightweight skeleton application

positional arguments:
  location           the directory to initialize site generator in

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --url URL          the url of the generated site
  --title TITLE      the title of of the generated site
  --authors AUTHORS  comma-separated list of names
```

## Dev Server

Lightweight includes a simple static web server with live reload serving at `localhost:8080`:
```bash
lw serve site:dev
```
Here `site` is a Python module 

Host and port can be set via:
```bash
lw serve site:dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80
```

The directory to resolve the module is provided as `--source`. It defaults to cwd.
The source directory is watched for live reload. 
```bash
lw serve site:dev --source ~/Projects/example
```

The live reload can be disabled with `--no-live-reload` flag:
```bash
lw serve site:dev --no-live-reload
```
Otherwise every served HTML file will be injected with a javascript that polls `/__live_reload_id__`.
The script reloads the page when value at that location changes.
That happens after regenerating the site upon change in `--source` directory.

To stop the server press `Ctrl+C` in terminal.
