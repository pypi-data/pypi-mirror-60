## Introduction
It's better to start with notebooks listed below to understand Retentioneering:

### [First steps](https://retentioneering.github.io/retentioneering-tools/_build/html/early_steps.html#first-steps)
Configuration, preparing your data graph basics.

### [Temporal funnel](https://retentioneering.github.io/retentioneering-tools/_build/html/early_steps.html#temporal-funnel)
Also known as Step Matrix.

### [Clustering](https://retentioneering.github.io/retentioneering-tools/_build/html/early_steps.html#clustering)

## Mobile application cases
In this example we will perform an analysis for the app focusing on investigation why people remove app.

### [Analysis](https://retentioneering.github.io/retentioneering-tools/_build/html/mobile-app-case.html#analysis)
Step matrix and clustering.
### [Predict application remove](https://retentioneering.github.io/retentioneering-tools/_build/html/mobile-app-case.html#predict-app-remove)
