PSLS: the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator

PSLS simulates solar-like oscillators representative for PLATO observations. The simulator includes planetary transits, stochastically-excited oscillations, granulation and activity background components, as well as instrumental systematic errors and random noises representative for PLATO. The program also manages the existence of a time shift between groups of cameras. Planetary transits are included following Mandel & Agol (2002) equations (see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...580L.171M) and using the Python implementation by Ian Crossfield (http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ianc/) at UCLA.

The package provides the code and two files storing the parameters describing the PLATO systematic errors:
- PLATO_systematics_BOL.npy: End Of Life (EOL) systematic errors
- PLATO_systematics_EOL.npy: Begining Of Life (BOL)  systematic errors

The package also provides two working examples:
- a main sequence star (0012069449.yaml) with its associated theoretical frequencies (0012069449.gsm) generated by ADIPLS pulsation code
- a red giant star (0009882316.yaml), which does not require as input theoretical frequencies.

A couple of grids of models can be downloaded from the PSLS website (http://psls.lesia.obspm.fr).

Changes history:
- 1.1 (03/02/20): Some Python3 compatibility issues corrected. New option "-m" generating merged light-curves, new option -M to perform Monte-Carlo simulations 
- 1.0 (05/09/19): Implementation of the V-P color-magnitude relation from Marchiori et al (2019). The option -f saves now each individual light-curves. Oscillations can be turned off. New format for the input file (YAML). PLATO NSR values are now available down to magnitude P=15.6. 
- 0.9 (20/05/19): the NSR table was incorrectly interpolated. V mangitudes ranging between 12 and 13 were affected. 
- 0.85 (23/03/19): minor changes to be make the code fully compatible with python3
- 0.8 (23/02/19): systematic errors are now modelled and simulated in the time domain. The jumps induced by the quasi-regular mask updates are now included. Version corresponding to the published paper Samadi et al (2019, A&A, 624, 117)
- 0.7 (10/12/18): inclusion of PLATO systematic errors and random noise as a function of the star V magnitude
- 0.6: minor problems fixed (missing file,  link problem)
- 0.5: can perform simulation for a given input set of theoretical frequencies (i.e. from a given .gsm file) ; new parameters included in the configuration file .yaml ; various minor improvements
- 0.4: minor changes
- 0.3: first working version
