## CHANGELOG: sphobjinv -- Sphinx objects.inv Inspection/Manipulation Tool

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project strives to adhere to
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


### [2.0.1] - 2020-01-26

#### Fixed

 * attr.s usage on Inventory changed to use eq=False where possible,
   per the deprecation of the cmp argument
 * URL inventory retrieval now sends a User-Agent header, to avoid
   403 FORBIDDEN errors on some docs servers


### [2.0.1rc1] - 2019-02-01

#### Fixed

 * Sphinx *can* generate inventories with empty-string values for
   `project` and `version`; `sphobjinv` now can import such
   inventories without error.


### [2.0.0] - 2018-08-16

#### Added

 * Loading remote inventories from the CLI now will
   perform an automatic walk along the directory structure of the
   provided URL, searching for the objects.inv file of the
   documentation set.
 * The above URL walking functionality is exposed for API use
   at sphobjinv.fileops.urlwalk.

#### Changed

 * Instances of DataObjStr and DataObjBytes are NO LONGER IMMUTABLE.
   Working with Inventory instances was going to be far too cumbersome
   with immutable DataObjStr instances in .objects.


### [2.0.0rc1] - 2018-05-18

#### Fixed

 * API code no longer contains any `sys.exit` calls;
   CLI interactions should now be properly segregated from the internal API

#### Added

 * API
   * Data for individual objects encapsulated in the new `.data.DataObjStr` and `.data.DataObjBytes` classes
     * Instances of these objects provide granular access to the contained data
     * Instances are *immutable*, but expose an `evolve()` method for creating new, (optionally) modified instances.
   * Entire inventory contents, as a `list` of `DataObjStr`, encapsulated in `.inventory.Inventory` instances
     * `Inventory` instances are anticipated to be the primary point of user interface to inventory data
     * `.suggest()` method added, exploiting fuzzy string searching by [`fuzzywuzzy`](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy) for rapid searching of inventories for objects of interest
     * Import of remote `objects.inv` files via `urllib.request` and `certifi` implemented.
   * Helper methods are provided for working with the `objects.inv` shorthands for object URI and display-name information, on both `DataObj...` and `Inventory` instances.
   * `readjson`/`writejson` helper functions added to `.fileops`
   * JSON schema added to `.schema` for use with [`jsonschema`](https://pypi.org/project/jsonschema) to validate incoming data during `Inventory` instantiation from  JSON
 * Command-line interface
   * Add `suggest` subparser, for recommendation of matching objects within an input inventory
   * Add ability to read and write JSON inventories
   * Add ability to use a remote `objects.inv` file (arbitrary filename) as input, specified by URL
   * Add arguments to:
     * Expand/contract the `objects.inv` URI and 'display name' abbreviations
     * Force overwrite of an existing output file without prompting
     * Silence all output (mainly intended for scripting applications); includes automatic overwriting of an existing output file
     * Various arguments to control the output of a `sphobjinv suggest` invocation

#### Changed

 * `readfile`/`writefile` changed to `readbytes`/`writebytes`
   and moved to new `.fileops` submodule
 * `decode`/`encode` changed to `decompress`/`compress` and moved to new `.zlib` submodule
 * `p_data`/`p_comments` regex patterns renamed with `pb_` prefix to indicate they are `bytes`, not `str` patterns
 * CLI
   * Commands for (de)compressing `objects.inv` files changed to a more general `convert` subparser, due to addition of JSON output option
   * Default filename/extension assumptions removed from input file argument, as multiple input formats make the logic here complicated enough it's not worth messing with

### [1.0.0] - 2016-05-24

#### Features

 * Flexible commandline encode and decode of objects.inv
   files, in terms of file names and input/output locations
 * Programmatic conversion via API is available, but
   potentially buggy due to poor segregation of cmdline
   behaviors. This is to be fixed.
