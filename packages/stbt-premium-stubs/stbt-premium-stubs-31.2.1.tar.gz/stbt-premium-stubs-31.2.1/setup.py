* Copyright Â© 2018-2020 Stb-tester.com Ltd.

This package contains API stubs for Stb-tester's premium features (such as
audio capture & analysis) which are only available when you run your test
scripts on the [Stb-tester Node] hardware. Installing this package will allow
your IDE to provide better linting & autocompletion, but you won't be able to
run these APIs locally.
