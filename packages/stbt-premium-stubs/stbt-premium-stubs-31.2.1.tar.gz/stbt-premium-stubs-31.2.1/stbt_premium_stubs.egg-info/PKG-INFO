        This package contains API stubs for Stb-tester's premium features (such as
        audio capture & analysis) which are only available when you run your test
        scripts on the [Stb-tester Node] hardware. Installing this package will allow
        your IDE to provide better linting & autocompletion, but you won't be able to
        run these APIs locally.
