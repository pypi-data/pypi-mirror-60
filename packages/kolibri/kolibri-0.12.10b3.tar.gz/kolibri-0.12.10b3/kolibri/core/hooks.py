Kolibri Core hooks
------------------

WIP! Many applications are supposed to live inside the core namespace to make
it explicit that they are part of the core.

Do we put all their hooks in one module or should each app have its own hooks
module?

Anyways, for now to get hooks started, we have some defined here...
