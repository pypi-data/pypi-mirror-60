SMTP user enumeration via `VRFY` and `EXPN` with clever timeout, retry and reconnect functionality.

Some SMTP server take a long time for initial communication (banner and greeting) and then
handle subsequent commands quite fast. Then again they randomly start to get slow again.

This implementation of SMTP user enumeration counteracts with granular timeout, retry and
reconnect options for initial communication and enumeration separately.
The defaults should work fine, however if you encounter slow enumeration, adjust the settings
according to your needs.

Additionally if it encounters anything like `421 Too many errors on this connection` it will
automatically and transparently reconnect and continue from where it left off.


## Installation
```bash
pip install smtp-user-enum
```


## Usage

```bash
$ smtp-user-enum --help

usage: smtp-user-enum [options] -u/-U host port
       smtp-user-enum --help
       smtp-user-enum --version

## VRFY mode (default)

> The SMTP "VRFY" command allows you to verify whether a the system can deliver mail to a particular user.

### Successful VRFY mode output

```bash
$ smtp-user-enum -U /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_users.txt mail.example.tld 25

### Failed VRFY mode output

In case the VRFY mode is not successful as shown below, you will need to try out a different mode.

```bash
$ smtp-user-enum -U /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_users.txt mail.example.tld 25

Connecting to mail.example.tld 25 ...
220 mail.example.tld ESMTP Sendmail 8.12.8/8.12.8; Wed, 22 Jan 2020 19:33:07 +0200

```


## EXPN mode

> The SMTP "EXPN" command allows you to expand a mailing list or alias, to see where mail addressed to the alias actually goes. For example, many organizations alias postmaster to root, so that mail addressed to postmaster will get delivered to the system administrator. Issuing "EXPN postmaster" via SMTP would reveal that postmaster is aliased to root.
>
> The "EXPN" command can be used by attackers to learn about valid usernames on the target system. On some SMTP servers, EXPN can be used to show the subscribers of a mailing list -- subscription lists are generally considered to be sensitive information.

### Successful EXPN mode output

```bash
$ smtp-user-enum -m EXPN -U /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_users.txt mail.example.tld 25

Connecting to mail.example.tld 25 ...
220 mail.example.tld ESMTP Sendmail 8.12.8/8.12.8; Wed, 22 Jan 2020 19:33:07 +0200

```

**Note:** the right side shows to what mailbox the email will be forwarded for the alias.
