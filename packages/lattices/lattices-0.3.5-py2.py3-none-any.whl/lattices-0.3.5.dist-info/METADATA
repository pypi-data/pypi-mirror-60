Lattices
========

|build| |codecov| |readthedocs|

``Lattices`` is a package for the construction of lattices from a set of nodes
and an (partial) ordering relation.

Drawing
-------

Lattices optionally utilizes `nxpd` to draw a lattice. This package is somewhat
out of date at this point, and you install a modified version:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://git@github.com/chebee7i/nxpd.git@refs/pull/15/merge#egg=nxpd
