* Python package for probability density fitting and hypothesis testing.
* Probability density fitting is the fitting of a probability distribution to a series of data concerning the repeated measurement of a variable phenomenon. distfit scores each of the 89 different distributions for the fit wih the emperical distribution and return the best scoring distribution.

## Four functions are available:
```python
# To make the distribution fit with the input data
.fit()
# Compute probabilities using the fitted distribution
.proba_parametric()
# Compute probabilities in an emperical manner
.proba_emperical()
# Plot results
.plot()

See below for the exact working of the functions
```

## Installation
* Install distfit from PyPI (recommended). distfit is compatible with Python 3.6+ and runs on Linux, MacOS X and Windows. 
* It is distributed under the MIT license.

## Requirements
```python
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Quick Start
```
pip install distfit
```

* Alternatively, install distfit from the GitHub source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/erdogant/distfit.git
cd distfit
python setup.py install
```  
## Import distfit package
```python
import distfit as dist
```
### Generate some random data:
```python
import numpy as np
data=np.random.normal(5, 8, [1000])
```
#### data looks like this:
```
array([[-12.65284521,  -3.81514715,  -4.53613236],
       [ 11.5865475 ,   2.42547023,   6.6395518 ],
       [  3.82076163,   6.65765319,   9.95795751],
       ...,
       [  3.65728268,   7.298237  ,  -4.25641318],
       [  7.51820943,  16.26147929,  -0.60033084],
       [  2.49165326,   3.97880574,   7.98986818]])
```
## Example fitting best scoring distribution to input-data:
```python
model = dist.fit(data)
dist.plot(model)
```
#### Output looks like this:
```
[DISTFIT] Checking for [norm] [SSE:0.000152]
[DISTFIT] Checking for [expon] [SSE:0.021767] 
[DISTFIT] Checking for [pareto] [SSE:0.054325] 
[DISTFIT] Checking for [dweibull] [SSE:0.000721]
[DISTFIT] Checking for [t] [SSE:0.000139]
[DISTFIT] Checking for [genextreme] [SSE:0.050649]
[DISTFIT] Checking for [gamma] [SSE:0.000152]
[DISTFIT] Checking for [lognorm] [SSE:0.000156]
[DISTFIT] Checking for [beta] [SSE:0.000152]
[DISTFIT] Checking for [uniform] [SSE:0.015671] 
[DISTFIT] Estimated distribution: t [loc:5.239912, scale:7.871518]

note that the best fit should be [normal], as this was also the input data. 
However, many other distributions can be very similar with specific loc/scale parameters. 
In this case, the t-distribution scored slightly better then normal. The normal distribution 
scored similar to gamma and beta which is not strange to see. 
If you dont understand why, do some homework first ;)

## Example Compute probability whether values are of interest compared 95%CII of the data distribution:
```python
expdata=[-20,-12,-8,0,1,2,3,5,10,20,30,35]
# Use fitted model
model_P = dist.proba_parametric(expdata, data, model=model)
# Make plot
dist.plot(model)
```

  <img src="https://github.com/erdogant/distfit/blob/master/docs/figs/fig2b.png" width="400" />
</p>

```python
# Its also possible to do the distribution fit in the proba_ function:
model_P = dist.proba_parametric(expdata, data)
```
