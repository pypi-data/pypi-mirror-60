# OpenBioLink

OpenBioLink is a resource and evaluation framework for evaluating link prediction models on heterogeneous biomedical graph data. It contains benchmark datasets as well as the underlying scrips to create them and to evaluate a costume model on them.

## Installation

### Pip
1) Install a pytorch version suitable for your system https://pytorch.org/
2) ```pip install openbiolink```

### Source
1) clone the git repository or download the project
1) Create a new python3.7, or python3.6 virtual environment  *(note: under Windows, only python3.6 will work)*
e.g.:
```python3 -m venv my_venv```
1) activate the virtual environment
    * windows: ``my_venv\Scrips\activate``
    * linux/mac: ``source my_venv/bin/activate``
1) Install a pytorch version suitable for your system https://pytorch.org/
1) Install the requirements stated in requirements.txt e.g.  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Benchmark Dataset
 The [OpenBioLink2020 Dataset](https://samwald.info/res/OpenBioLink_2020/HQ_DIR.zip) is a highly challenging
 benchmark dataset containing over 5 million positive and negative edges.
 The test set does not contain trivially predictable, inverse edges from the training set 
 and does contain all different edge types, to provide a more realistic edge prediction
 scenario.

To also be able to analyze the effect of the data quality as well as the directionality of the 
evaluation graph other settings of OpenBioLink2020 are provided, in directed and undirected setting,
with and without quality cutoff.

* [OpenBioLink2020: directed, high quality](https://samwald.info/res/OpenBioLink_2020/HQ_DIR.zip) (default dataset)
* [OpenBioLink2020: undirected, high quality](https://samwald.info/res/OpenBioLink_2020/HQ_UNDIR.zip)
* [OpenBioLink2020: directed, no quality cutoff](https://samwald.info/res/OpenBioLink_2020/ALL_DIR.zip)
* [OpenBioLink2020: undirected, no quality cutoff](https://samwald.info/res/OpenBioLink_2020/ALL_UNDIR.zip)


## Manual

The OpenBioLink framework consists of three parts, called actions
 1) graph creation
 2) train-test split creation
 3) training and evaluation

With the graph creation and the train-test set action, costumed data sets can be created to suit individual needs.
The last action serves as interface to train and evaluate link prediction models.

#### Calling via GUI
By calling the program without any parameters, the gui is started, 
providing a handy interface to define parameters needed. In the last step, 
the corresponding command line options are displayed.

#### Calling via command line
From folder src
```python -m openbiolink.openBioLink -p WORKING_DIR_PATH [-action] [--options] ...```
