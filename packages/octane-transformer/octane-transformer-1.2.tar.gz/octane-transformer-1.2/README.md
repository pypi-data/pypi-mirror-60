# octane-transformer
Transforming data generated tools like CA ARD, HP ALM to ALM Octane

## Purpose
This custom solution bridges the gap between widely known tools in the market, namely CA Agile Requirements Designer [ARD], HP Application Lifecycle Management [ALM] and MicroFocus ALM Octane.

Currently, CA ARD provides an integration capability with HP QC/ALM and automatically uploads the test cases generated from ARD to QC/ALM. However, CA ARD and does not integrate with the advanced version of QC/ALM, which is MicroFocus ALM Octane. Likewise, test cases in HP ALM cannot be directly fed into Octane. 

A custom solution is written in Python which reads the data generated from CA ARD or HP ALM [.xlsx], transforms and writes the data [.xlsx] to Octane undestandable format. The transformed data in [.xlsx] is further used for import into ALM Octane.

For the easy of usage, custom solution is wrapped as a standard python package using PYPI and made available as **ard-transformer**
