        Lock-In Analyzer
        -------------------------
        This module allows to compute magnitude and phase from thermal images implementing a lock-in digital analyzer. Peak amplitude and phase are obtained from thermal image sequence.
        We developed this module while working on images recorded from FLIR thermal camera.
