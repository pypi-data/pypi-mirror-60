The library can be used for writing other UPB\napplications. The IO with the PIM is asynchronous over TCP or over the\nserial port.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n    $ pip install upb_lib\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nDetails TBD\n  \nSimplest thing right now is when in the root of the git repo that you have cloned is to enter the command `bin/simple`. You need the environment variable `UPBPIM_URL` set. Mine is set to `serial:///dev/cu.KeySerial1` on a MacBook. What is constant is `serial://` followed by the USB port that the PIM is on, which in my case is `/dev/cu.KeySerial1`. On Windows is might be something like `COM1`.\n\nAlso required is a `UPStart` export file. Mine is in the `bin` directory and named `upb.upe`. The `simple` program looks for it there.\n\nThis is all under very active development and will change. But if you really want to get up and running... Go for it!\n\n## Development\n\nThis project uses [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) for development dependencies. Installation instructions are on their website.\n\nTo get started developing:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/gwww/upb-lib.git\ncd upb\npoetry install\npoetry shell # Or activate the created virtual environment\nmake test # to ensure everything installed properly\n```\n\nThere is a `Makefile` in the root directory as well. The `make` command\nfollowed by one of the targets in the `Makefile` can be used. If you don't\nhave or wish to use `make` the `Makefile` serves as examples of common\ncommands that can be run.\n",
