    subject_name : str
        The anonymised ID of the subject (optional)
    session_id : str

        It is recommended to leave it blank, except for testing specific tools
        for processing uploaded data.
    is_result : bool
        Default value: False. Set to True if the uploaded data is the output
        of an offline analysis.
    add_to_container_id : int
        ID of the container to which this file should be added (if id > 0).
        Default value: 0. When the value is 0, the data will be added to
        a new container.
    split_data : bool
        If True, the platform will try to split the uploaded file into

    Class to upload a single ZIP file to the platform.
    When there is a failure in initializing the instance,

    Parameters
    ----------
    auth : Auth
        The object used to authenticate to the QMENTA platform.
    path : str
        The input directory or file that will be zipped (optional),
        anonymised (optional) and uploaded.
    file_info : FileInfo
        All the metadata for the file to be stored in the platform.
    anonymise : bool
        If set, a new zip file will be created with the same name which
        contains the anonymised version of the data of the original
        zip file. The new zip file will be uploaded instead of the original
        one. Default value: True.
    upload_index : int
        This value will be passed to the 'upload-status' and 'upload-progress'
        signals. It is set by MultipleThreadedUploads and used to quickly
        identify the upload that was updated. Default value: -1.
    keep_created_files : bool
        Keep the files containing the zipped directory and anonymised data
        after the upload finished. When set to False, the ``qm-*.zip`` files
        that were created by this SingleUpload will be deleted when the upload
        if finished. Default value: True.

    Attributes
    ----------
    input_filename : str
        The file that will be anonymised (optional), and uploaded.
    upload_filename : str
        The file that will be uploaded. If anonymisation is disabled, this
        will be the same as filename. With anonymisation enabled, a new file
        will be created that contains the anonymised data.
    upload_id : str
        The upload session ID. This will be automatically generated and
        depends on the current time and the upload filename.
    chunk_size : int
        Size in bytes of each chunk. Should be expressed as a power of 2.
        Default value is 512 KB.
        It is recommended to use the default value. We expose the variable
        to speed up unit tests with tiny file sizes.
    file_size : int
        The size in bytes of the file to be uploaded. Automatically determined
        when the SingleUpload object is constructed.
    status_message : str
        In case the status becomes FAILED, status_message will contain a
        message indicating what went wrong.
    last_response : Response (optional)
        This will store the response (from requests library) object from the
