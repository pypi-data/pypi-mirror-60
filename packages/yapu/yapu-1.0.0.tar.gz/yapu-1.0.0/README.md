Yet Another Python Utils library
==============================================================================

Yet Another Python Utils is a libray of generic wrappers around standard libraries 
that I've built over the years. 
In general these provide simpler defaults and nicer names functions that I use over 
and over.

The organization of this package was taken from [python-utils](https://github.com/WoLpH/python-utils)
