Description: # scadnano-python-package
        
        The scadnano Python module is a library for describing synthetic DNA nanostructures (e.g., DNA origami).
        
        This module is used to write Python scripts outputting `.dna` files readable by [scadnano](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~doty/scadnano/), a web application useful for displaying and manually editing these structures. The purpose of this module is to help automate some of the task of creating DNA designs, as well as making large-scale changes to them that are easier to describe programmatically than to do by hand in scadnano.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The scadnano Python package requires [Python version 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later. 
        
        There are two ways you can install the scadnano Python package:
        
        
        1. pip 
        
            Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install the package by executing the following at the command line:
            ```console
            pip install scadnano
            ```
        
            If your Python installation does not already have pip installed, you may have to install it. 
            Executing [this Python script](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) should work; 
            see also 
            https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html 
            or 
            https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/.
        
        2. download
        
            As a simple alternative, you can download and place the following file(s) (located in the [scadnano/](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano-python-package/tree/master/scadnano) subfolder)
            in your PYTHONPATH (e.g., in the same directory as the scripts you are running):
        
            * *required*: [scadnano.py](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano-python-package/blob/master/scadnano/scadnano.py) 
            * *optional*: [origami_rectangle.py](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano-python-package/blob/master/scadnano/origami_rectangle.py); This can help create origami rectangles, but it is not necessary to use scadnano.

        ## Examples
        
        Several example scripts are located in the 
        [examples/](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano-python-package/tree/master/examples) subfolder. 
        Their output is contained in the 
        [examples/output_designs/](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano-python-package/tree/master/examples/output_designs) subfolder.
