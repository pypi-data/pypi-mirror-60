The grossup consists of including due taxes and service fee into a given
principal augmenting it so its resulting net value equals the originally given
principal.

It seems fairly reasonable to assume the service fee is simply an aliquot
applied over the principal so, if :math:`S` is the principal and :math:`\gamma` is
the service fee aliquot, then the service fee given by :math:`\gamma S`.

On the other hand, it is hard to pin down a reasonable and generic expression
for due taxes, since they are very context bound and their rules might be
revised as laws are amended.

This is addressed by a grossup solver, which approximates solutions
for the grossup problem given the user provides python implementations of some
mathematical functions. Such mathematical functions are

*   :math:`a = a(s, d, (n_1,\ldots,n_k))` returning :math:`(a_1,\ldots,a_k)` a
    vector of amortizations, where :math:`s` is the principal, :math:`d` is the
    daily interest rate and :math:`n_i` is the :math:`i`-th return day,
*   :math:`f = f((a_1,\ldots,a_k), (n_1,\ldots,n_k))`, where :math:`a_i`
    is the :math:`i`-th amortization and :math:`n_i` is the :math:`i`-th the
    return day,
*   :math:`c = c(s)`, where :math:`s` is the principal,
*   :math:`g = g(s)`, where :math:`s` is the principal.

The grossed up principal is then approximated as a positive real root of the
function

.. math::

    s \longmapsto
    s_\circ
    - (s - f(a(s, d, (n_1,\ldots,n_k)), (n_1,\ldots,n_k))
    - c(s)
    - g(s)).
