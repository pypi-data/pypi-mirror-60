        setup
        =====
        
        This utility requires X11.
        
        Install PyQt5. On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, run the following:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt install python-qt5
        
        On Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, run the following:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt install pyqt5-dev pyqt5-dev-tools
        
        Now install spin by running the following:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo pip install python_spin
        
        To set up globally a Linux desktop launcher with icon, execute the
        following:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo wget --content-disposition -N -P /usr/share/icons/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wdbm/spin/master/python_spin/static/spin.svg
        
            sudo wget --content-disposition -N -P /usr/share/applications/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wdbm/spin/master/python_spin/static/spin.desktop
        
        quick start
        ===========
        
        This utility can be run in its default graphical mode or in a
        non-graphical mode. The graphical mode is engaged by running
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            spin
        
        while the non-graphical mode is engaged by using the option
        ``--no_GUI``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            spin --no_GUI
        
        There are other options which are described by ``spin --help``.
        
        By default, this utility disables the touchscreen on detecting the
        stylus in proximity and it changes between the laptop and tablet modes
        on detecting toggling between the laptop and tablet usage
        configurations. These default behaviours are provided by both the
        graphical and non-graphical modes of this utility. This utility should
        be initiated in the laptop usage configuration.

        acceleration control
        ====================
        
        There is an experimental acceleration control included which is
        deactivated by default. It can be activated by selecting the appropriate
        button in the graphical mode.
        
        future
        ======
        
        Under consideration is state recording in order to avoid execution of
        unnecessary commands and better handling of subprocesses.
