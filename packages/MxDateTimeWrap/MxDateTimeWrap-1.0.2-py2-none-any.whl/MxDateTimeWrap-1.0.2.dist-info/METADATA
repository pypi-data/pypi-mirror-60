# MxDateTimeWrap

It's basically a wrapper around the "wonderful" mx.DateTime package to basically inject native datetime into it instead of it's native functionality.
Useful for fragile legacy code that heavily depends on mx.Datetime but you just don't feel like converting all the calls to native datetime.


## Usage
Install:
```
pip install mxDateTimeWrap
```
...and pretend it's mx.DateTime.
