        Features
        --------
        
        * Enables an easier to parse and more understandable diff for your failing tests.
        * Can display unified diffs or split diffs, and chooses them depending on the context.
        * Adds helpful hints to the output for failing tests to help you track down common issues.

        ::
        
            pytest -vv --no-hints
        
        You can configure the width of the output with the :code:`--diff-width` option:
        
        ::
        
            pytest -vv --diff-width=60
