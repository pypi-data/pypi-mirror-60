# Rabbit MQ Clients

An attempt to simplify RabbitMQ messaging like a Flask URL Route


### Installation

From pip

```bash
$ pip install rabbit-clients
```

From source

```python
python setup.py install
```

*NOTE:* ```Rabbit-Clients``` looks for the following environment variables:

* ```RABBIT_HOST``` - RabbitMQ FQDN, defaults to ```localhost```
* ```RABBIT_USER``` - User for authentication, defaults to ```guest```
* ```RABBIT_PW``` - Password for authentication, defaults to ```guest```


### Usage Example

You may only have one consumer per module/service.  A user can publish as much as desired.

```python
from rabbit_clients import PublishMessage, ConsumeMessage


@PublishMessage(queue='younguns')
def publish_to_younguns(message):
    return message


@PublishMessage(queue='aaron_detect')
def check_for_aaron(consumed_message):
    return_message = {'name': consumed_message['name'], 'isAaron': False}
    if return_message['name']  == 'Aaron':
        return_message['isAaron'] = True
    return return_message


@ConsumeMessage(queue='oldfolks')
def remove_forty_and_up(message_dict = None):
    people = message_dict['people']
    not_protected_class = [younger for younger in people if younger['age'] < 40]
    message_dict['people'] = not_protected_class
    
    check_for_aaron(message_dict)
    publish_to_younguns(message_dict)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    remove_forty_and_up()  # Listening for messages

```
