Description: # PyCO2SYS v0.1
        
        **PyCO2SYS** is a Python implementation of CO2SYS, based on the [MATLAB version 2.0.5](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-MATLAB). This software calculates the full marine carbonate system from values of any two of its variables.
        
        > **Some basic comparisons have not shown any differences in the results, but a thorough intercomparison between the MATLAB and Python has not yet been carried out - so use at your own risk (for now)!**
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install PyCO2SYS
        
        ## Usage
        
        Usage has been kept as close to the MATLAB version as possible, although the first output is now a dict for convenience:
        
        ```python
        from PyCO2SYS import CO2SYS
        co2dict = CO2SYS(PAR1, PAR2, PAR1TYPE, PAR2TYPE, SAL, TEMPIN, TEMPOUT, PRESIN,
                         PRESOUT, SI, PO4, pHSCALEIN, K1K2CONSTANTS, KSO4CONSTANTS)[0]
        ```
        
        Vector inputs should be provided as Numpy arrays (either row or column, makes no difference which).
        
        See also the example scripts in the repo.
        
        ## Differences from the MATLAB original
        
        Inputs are the same as in the MATLAB version, with vectors of input values provided as Numpy arrays. Outputs are also the same, with the exception that an extra output `DICT` comes before the MATLAB three (`DATA`, `HEADERS` and `NICEHEADERS`) - this contains the numerical results in `DATA` but in a dict with the names in `HEADERS` as the keys. Note also that `DATA` in the Python version is the transpose of the same variable in the MATLAB version.
