CHANGES
=======

* Fix bug of rain creation unit
* Add create rain geners without adding them into dat directly, include rain history
* Fix incorrect one atmosphere pressure (10035 pa to 10325 pa)
* Update to use PyTOUGH's t2data.json() writing waiwera json input
* Caching objects, so can call populate multiple times efficiently
* Remove comments
* Add dilation for CM Faults, stats are area ratio if dilation > 0
* Change major data structure, faults CM no longer boolen, just 1.0 and 0.0

0.1

* Tweak error message of fail loading BMStats
* Fix BMStats does not need to worry about atmosphere blocks
* Ensure BMStats uses relative path for npy file in .save() and .load()
* Change class ZoneStats to new name BMStats, and add class comments
* Remove excess print for testing
* Add ZoneStats.save() and ZoneStats.load()
* Fix ZoneStats stats array size, should be the same as geo.num\_blocks
* Add ZoneStats class, keeping stats info generated by CM, can add two or more CMs
* Add CM for simple polygon prism.  Giving similar stats like other CMs
* Change polygon cache property name in mulgrid object, also add dictionary
* Allow CM\_Blocky to be used in a customised way, without dealing with t2grid/geological model
* Add ability to process cascade river/lake style wet boundary conditions
* Improve column polygon caching, now can be reused
* Improve wet surface processing now can provide overwrite col surface
* Update block geology now returns new rock name
* Add utility for adding rain generators
* Add utility for adding upflows
* Add utility for adding heatflow
* Atmospheric blocks are layer zero
* Reorganise model creation codes, now external, cmflow is just a library
* Remove unused debugging code and dependency
* Reorganise directory and files a bit
* Change fault CM testing into a function
* Remove useless code, CM very slightly faster now
* Add CM for faults, still slow
* Add 3D face module for fault calculation, and its test cases
* Add .gitignore file, exclude most things apart from codes
* Roughly working, initial commit
