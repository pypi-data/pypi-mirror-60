        ## The Arid Manifesto
        * Paths as keys to avoid key concatenation
        * It's never necessary to repeat a value
        * Minimal syntax for surprise-free authoring
        * Lazy context-sensitive evaluation
        * Strongly (dynamically) typed values
        * Central defaulting rather than at call sites
        * Templating using same syntax as expressions
        * Easy to correctly quote/escape values in templates
        * Extensibility via user-defined functions
        * Easy tasks are easy, hard tasks are possible
        * Many applications can share one user config
        * Principle of least astonishment driven design
