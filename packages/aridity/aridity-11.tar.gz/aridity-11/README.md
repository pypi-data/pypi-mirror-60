## The Arid Manifesto
* Paths as keys to avoid key concatenation
* It's never necessary to repeat a value
* Minimal syntax for surprise-free authoring
* Lazy context-sensitive evaluation
* Strongly (dynamically) typed values
* Central defaulting rather than at call sites
* Templating using same syntax as expressions
* Easy to correctly quote/escape values in templates
* Extensibility via user-defined functions
* Easy tasks are easy, hard tasks are possible
* Many applications can share one user config
* Principle of least astonishment driven design
