Description: # General instructions for building for pip distribution
        
        After changing `setup.py` or any part of the Graffiti codebase, increase the version number in setup.py appropriately.
        
        Then run the commands shown below to upgrade what's stored in pip
        
        ``` shell
        python3 setup.py prep_to_build npm_run_build sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        Uploading to the pypi test servers:
        
        ``` shell
        python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/* --verbose
        ```
        
        Installing to a host in the cloud, from the test servers:
        ``` shell
        python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ jupytergraffiti
        ```
        
        Testing new installation on cloud host:
        
        ``` shell
        jupyter notebook —port=3001 —ip=127.0.0.1 —allow-root
        ```
        
        Uploading to the pypi production servers:
        
        ``` shell
        python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://pypi.org/legacy/ dist/* --verbose
        ```
        
        # General instructions for building for conda distribution
        
        
        NB: this relies on jupytergraffiti being in the main (production) pypi repository.
        
        ```
        mkdir conda
        cd conda
        conda skeleton pypi jupytergraffiti
        conda install conda-verify
        ```
        
        Modify meta.yaml to include `build   noarch:  generic`.
        
        Building on macosx:
        
        ```
        conda build jupytergraffiti
        anaconda upload /Users/will/anaconda/conda-bld/osx-64/jupytergraffiti-1.0.1.8-py36_0.tar.bz2
        ```
        
        Then you want to convert to other architectures and upload these as well:
        
        ```
        conda convert --platform all ~/anaconda/conda-bld/osx-64/jupytergraffiti-1.0.1.8-py36_0.tar.bz2 -o linux64_out
        anaconda upload linux64_out/linux-64/jupytergraffiti-1.0.1.8-py36_0.tar.bz2
        ```
        ... etc for all the architectures you want to support.
        
        
        To install you should be able to do :
        
        ```
        conda install -c willkessler jupytergraffiti
        ```
