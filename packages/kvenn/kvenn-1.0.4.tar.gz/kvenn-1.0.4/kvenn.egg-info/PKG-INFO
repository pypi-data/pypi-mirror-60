Description: kvenn
        =========
        
        CLI Tool for doing set-operations on lines of input. Each line is treated as an item in a set. Each input is treated as a set.
        
        ## Usage
        
        
            usage: kvenn [-h] [-n] [-s] [-f]
                         [-o {+,-,x,d,union,difference,intersection,unique}]
                         sets [sets ...]
        
            positional arguments:
              sets                  Each file is a set and each line in the file is a
                                    member of the set
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -n, --non-empty       non-empty values only
              -s, --strip           strip surrounding whitespace
              -f, --filter          strip and filter to non-empty
              -o {+,-,x,d,union,difference,intersection,unique}, --operation {+,-,x,d,union,difference,intersection,unique}
                                    Operation to perform on the sets [-] Subtract sets
                                    1...N from set 0 [+] Get the union of sets 0...N [x]
                                    Get the intersection of sets 0...N [d] Symmetric
                                    difference (disjunctive union). Elements from all sets
                                    which are not in any others.
        
        
        ## Examples
        
        
        Unique values in a file
        
            kvenn <input>
        
        Unique values in two or more files (Also `--union`)
        
            kvenn <input1> <input2> <inputN>
        
        
        Values found in both files
        
            kvenn <input1> <input2> --operation intersection
        
        
        Values found in only one file
        
            kvenn <input1> <input2> <inputN> --operation unique
        
        
        Values found in only one file
        
            kvenn <input1> <input2> <inputN> --operation unique
        
        
        Subtract values in B (and C, D.. etc) from A. (Unique values from A)
        
            kvenn <inputA> <inputB> [<inputC>] --operation subtract
