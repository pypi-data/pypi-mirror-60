[![Build Status](https://jenkins-master-deephealth-unix01.ing.unimore.it/badge/job/DeepHealth/job/pyecvl/job/master/linux_end?)](https://jenkins-master-deephealth-unix01.ing.unimore.it/job/DeepHealth/job/pyecvl/job/master/)

**PyECVL** is a Python wrapper for [ECVL](https://github.com/deephealthproject/ecvl), the European Computer Vision Library.


Each PyECVL version requires a specific ECVL version:

PyECVL version | ECVL version |
-------------- | ------------ |
0.1.0          | 0.1.0        |


## Quick start

The following assumes you have ECVL already installed in "standard"
system paths (e.g., `/usr/local/include`, `/usr/local/lib`).

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/deephealthproject/pyecvl.git
    cd pyecvl
    python3 -m pip install numpy pybind11 pytest
    python3 setup.py install

See [full installation instructions below](#installation).


## Getting started

```python
import numpy as np
import pyecvl._core.ecvl as ecvl

def inc_brightness(img, rate):
    a = np.array(img, copy=False)
    max_val = np.iinfo(a.dtype).max
    a[a > max_val - rate] = max_val
    a[a <= max_val - rate] += rate

def main():
    img = ecvl.ImRead("test.jpg")
    inc_brightness(img, 10)
    ecvl.ImWrite("test_mod.jpg", img)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3
- ECVL
- NumPy
- pybind11
- pytest (if you want to run the tests)


### ECVL Installation

Complete ECVL installation instructions are available at
https://github.com/deephealthproject/ecvl. Here is a sample build sequence:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/deephealthproject/pyecvl.git
cd third_party/ecvl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DECVL_WITH_DICOM=ON -DECVL_WITH_OPENSLIDE=ON -DECVL_DATASET_PARSER=ON -DECVL_BUILD_EDDL=ON ..
make
make install
```


### PyECVL installation

Install PyECVL as follows:

```
python3 -m pip install numpy pybind11 pytest
python3 setup.py install
```

Then, you can test your installation by running the PyECVL tests:

    pytest tests


### Disabling unwanted modules

By default, PyECVL assumes a complete ECVL installation, including optional
modules (except for the GUI), and builds bindings for all of them. You can
disable support for specific modules via environment variables. For instance,
suppose you installed ECVL without openslide support: by default, PyECVL will
try to build the bindings for openslide-specific ECVL tools and link the
openslide library, which might not even be present on your system. To avoid
this, set the `ECVL_WITH_OPENSLIDE` environment variable to `OFF` (or `FALSE`)
before building PyECVL. Similarly, you can turn off DICOM and EDDL support by
setting `ECVL_WITH_DICOM` and `ECVL_EDDL` to `OFF`.


### ECVL installed in an arbitrary directory

The above installation instructions assume ECVL has been installed in standard
system paths. However, ECVL can be installed in an arbitrary directory,
for instance:

```
cd third_party/ecvl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/myuser/ecvl -DECVL_WITH_DICOM=ON -DECVL_WITH_OPENSLIDE=ON -DECVL_DATASET_PARSER=ON -DECVL_BUILD_EDDL=ON ..
make
make install
```

You can tell the PyECVL setup script about this via the `ECVL_DIR` environment
variable:

```
export ECVL_DIR=/home/myuser/ecvl
python3 setup.py install
```

In this way, `setup.py` will look for additional include files in
`/home/myuser/ecvl/include` and for additional libraries in
`/home/myuser/ecvl/lib`.

Similarly, if EDDL is installed in an arbitrary path, you can tell the setup
script via the `EDDL_DIR` environment variable.
