# graphene-django-framework

Don't want to use Relay with Graphene? You are not alone. All other packages for django implement the Relay interface. ðŸ˜ž

[Graphene-Django](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django) adds the ability to filter and paginate but you must follow the Relay specification which requires the use of Nodes, Edges, Connections, and Global IDs.

Apollo is a great GraphQL client and can still be used with Relay but has its downsides. 


## Install

    pip install graphene-django-framework
