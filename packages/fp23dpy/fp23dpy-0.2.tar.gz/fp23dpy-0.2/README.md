# Fringe Pattern to 3D python
This is a python package for applying phase demodulation and 3D reconstruction as post processing of Fringe Pattern (FP) images recorded using the Fringe Projection - Laser Induced Fluorescence (FP-LIF) technique.
The package has been developed at the division of Combustion Physics at Lund University and a more detailed explanation of the technique is found in the article cited below.
For any questions and code errors please contact `adrian.roth@forbrf.lth.se`.

## Installation
First pip should be installed (search for on the internet) and then the `fp23dpy` package can be installed from either,

### pip
```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ fp23dpy
```


### [Source Code](https://data.spray-imaging.com/packages/fp23dpy)
Install using `python3 setup.py` add `develop` if you want it to update when the source is updated.


## Usage
```
python -m pf23dpy <FP-image>
```
it will as default output, write a 3D reconstruction wavefront `.obj` which can be imported into most 3D modelling software, for example Blender.
Other 3D file formats are supported with `--ext <extension>` flag such as `.stl` or `glb`.
Use `python -m pf23dpy -h` for more information of the behaviour of the program.

Examples of a pending drop 3D structure is found in the example folder of the source code.
To print example FP image in the `examples` directory run,
```
python example_drop.py
```
which will produce an FP image segmentation file and a calibration file as explained below.
Then try,
```
python -m pf23dpy example_drop.png
```
open the produced `reconstructed_example_drop.obj` in a 3D modelling program.

### Calibration
A calibration file can be used for each FP-LIF image, the program will try to calibrate from the given image but it is not as robust as doing it yourself.
The calibration filename is either `calibration_<FP-image-filename>.txt` or `calibration.txt` where this calibration will be default for the whole directory.
The file should include a JSON format object with the following attributes:
```
{
	"T":     float,		 # describing the fringe pattern period length of a plane 3D object
	"gamma": float,		 # float describing the angle in degrees of the fringe pattern in the image
	"theta": float,	 	 # the angle in degrees from the camera to the illumination direction (optional)
	"scale": float,  	 # scale of the image, number of pixels per meter (optional, will scale output to pixels otherwise)
	"phi":   float,	 	 # the rotation in degrees of the camera in spherical coordinates to the angle of the fringe pattern with a certain radius (optional)
	"Tlim":  list of floats  # suggestion of T limits to search within, will not always be respected (optional)
}
```
The script `fp23d calibrate <calibration-image>` can be used for easier calculation of `T` and `theta` from a calibration image.

### Segmentation
If only parts of the image has the required Fringe Pattern lines, which is the case example drop, a segmentation of the image should be produced as found for the example drop.
The segmented file should have filename `segmented_<FP-image-filename>`.
If a single segmentation file should be used for all FP images in the same directory the segmentation file can be called `segmentation.png`.
The file should have zero values for background pixels and non-zero for foreground pixels.
