# Jupyter template

A simple template for jupyter notebooks.

The extension sets up any new Jupyter Notebook 
with a conventional and general-purpose
template to shape Data Science analysis.

The template includes conventional sections,
like *Data Import*, *Processing* and *References*,
as well as code to perform common operations, like
importing and configuring charting libraries. 

Moreover, it prompts for a meaningful name whenever
you try and save a notebook called 'Untitled'. 

But don't worry, you can disable
this one.
