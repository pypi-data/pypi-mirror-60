Description: # Sprites Detection
        A [**sprite**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)>) is a small [**raster graphic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) (a **bitmap**) that represents an object such as a [character, a vehicle, a projectile, etc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1yBP5t-fSA)
        
        ## Sprite Sheet
        
        It is not uncommon for games to have tens to hundreds of sprites. Loading each of these as an individual image would consume a lot of memory and processing power. To help manage sprites and avoid using so many images, many games use [**sprite sheets**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crrFUYabm6E) (also known as **image sprites**).
        
        A sprite sheet consists of multiple sprites in one image. In other words, sprite sheets pack multiple sprites into a single picture. Using sprite sheet, video game developers create sprite sheet animation representing one or several animation sequences while only loading a single file:
        
        ![Metal Slug Sprites](metal_slug_sprite_sheet_large.png)
        
        ## Sprite Bounding Box
        
        A frame (**bounding box**) can be used to delimit the sprite in the sprite sheet. This bounding box is defined with two 2D points `top_left` and the `bottom_right`, which their respective coordinates `x` and `y` are relative to the top-left corner of the sprite sheet's image.
        
        For example:
        
        ![Shape Bounding Boxes](metal_slug_sprite_detection_bounding_boxes.png)
        
        ## Sprite Mask
        
        The mask of a sprite defines the 2D shape of the sprite. For example, the sprite sheet 
        contains 3 following sprites:
        
        
        ![Metal Slug Standing Stance](1.png)
        
        The masks of these sprites are respectively:
        
        ![](2.png)
        
        ## Aim of the project
        - Detect sprites packed in an image (sheet) and draw their masks and bounding boxes into a new image with the same size of the original image. <br/>
        - Present a 2D map of all the the sprites with their labels. <br/>
        
        ## Usage Information
        ### Prerequisites
        - `Python 3.6` is required. <br/>
        - `pip` is requied, to install `sudo apt install pip`
        ### Usage
        - `pip install Friendlyngoc` from your terminal
        - Example of functioning:
        
            - Input as a spritesheet
            !['3.png'](spritesheet.png)
        
            - A image with sprite masks
            !['spritesheet.png'](4.png)
        
            ```python
            >>> from Friendlyngoc_spriteutil.spriteutil import SpriteSheet
            >>> sprite_sheet = SpriteSheet('spritesheet.png')
            >>> sprites, labels = sprite_sheet.find_sprites()
            >>> len(sprites)
            22
            >>> # Create the mask image with bounding boxes.
            >>> image = sprite_sheet.create_sprite_labels_image()
            >>> image.save('sprites_masks.png')
            ```
