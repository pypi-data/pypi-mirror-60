It is observable by anyone who goes to the beach and watches the edge\nof the water "runup" and rundown the beach. It is comprised of two components:\n\n    - **setup**: the height of the time averaged superelevation of the mean water level\n      above the Still Water Level (SWL)\n    - **swash**: the height of the time varying fluctuation of the instantaneous water\n      level about the setup elevation\n\nSetup, swash and other components of Total Water Level (TWL) rise are shown in this\nhandy figure below.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisleaman/py-wave-runup/master/docs/_static/VitousekDoubling2017Fig1.jpg\n   :width: 500 px\n   :align: center\n..\n\n    | Figure from Vitousek et al. (2017) [#vit17]_\n\nWave runup can contribute a significant portion of the increase in TWL in coastal\nstorms causing erosion and inundation. For example, Stockdon et al. (2006) [#sto06]_\ncollated data from numerous experiments, some of which showed wave runup 2% excedence\nheights in excess of 3 m during some storms.\n\nGiven the impact such a large increase in TWL can have on coastlines, there has been\nmuch research conducted to try improve our understanding of wave runup processes.\nAlthough there are many processes which can influence wave runup (such as nonlinear\nwave transformation, wave reflection, three-dimensional effects, porosity, roughness,\npermeability and groundwater) [#cem06]_, many attempts have been made to derive\nempirical relatinoships based on easily measurable parameters. Typically, empirical\nwave runup models include:\n\n    - **Hs**: significant wave height\n    - **Tp**: peak wave length\n    - **beta**: beach slope\n\nThis python package attempts to consolidate the work done by others in this field and\ncollate the numerous empirical relationships for wave runup which have been published.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nAs there are many different empirical wave models out there, contributions are most\nwelcome.
