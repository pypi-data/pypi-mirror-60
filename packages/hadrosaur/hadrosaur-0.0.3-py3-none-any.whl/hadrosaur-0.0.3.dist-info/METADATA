# hadrosaur — computed resource management

![logo](docs/logo.jpg)

Do you want to compute thousands of resources (files, metadata, database imports, etc) in parallel, but have a hard time tracking completion status, errors, logs, and other runtime data? That's what this is for.

> **Work in progress**

## Quick usage tutorial

### Install

```sh
pip install hadrosaur
```

### Define a resource collection

Import the lib and initialize a project using a base directory. Files, metadata, and logs will all get stored under this directory.

```py
from hadrosaur import Project

proj = Project('./base_directory')
```

Define a collection using a decorator around a function. The collection should have a unique name and must take these params:

* `ident` — an identifier (unique across the collection) for each computed resource
* `args` — a dictionary of optional arguments
* `subdir` — the path of a directory in which you can store files for this resource

```py
@proj.resource('collection_name')
def compute_resource(ident, args, subdir):
  # Run some things...
  # Maybe save stuff into subdir... 
  time.sleep(1)
  # Return metadata for the resource, such as run results, filepaths, etc.
  return {'ts': time.time()}
```

### Fetch a resource

Use the `proj.fetch(collection_name, ident, args)` method to compute and cache resources in a collection.

* If the resource has not yet been computed, the function will be run
* If the resource was already computed in the past, then the saved results will get returned instantly
* If an error is thrown in the function, logs will be saved and the status will be updated
* If the function is backgrounded, then fetching the resource will show a "pending" status

```py
>> proj.fetch('collection_name', 'uniq_ident123', optional_args)
{
  'result': {'some': 'metadata'},
  'status': {'completed': True, 'pending': False, 'error': False},
  '_paths': {
    'base': 'base_directory/collection_name/uniq_ident123',
    'error': 'base_directory/collection_name/uniq_ident123/error.log',
    'stdout': 'base_directory/collection_name/uniq_ident123/stdout.log',
    'stderr': 'base_directory/collection_name/uniq_ident123/stderr.log',
    'status': 'base_directory/collection_name/uniq_ident123/status.json',
    'result': 'base_directory/collection_name/uniq_ident123/result.json',
    'storage': 'base_directory/collection_name/uniq_ident123/storage/'
  }
}
```

Descriptions of each of the returned fields:

* `'result'`: any JSON-serializable data returned by the resource's function
* `'status'`: whether the resource has been computed already ("completed"), is currently being computed ("pending"), or threw a Python error while running the function ("error")
* `'paths'`: All the various filesystem paths associated with your resource
  * `'base'`: The base directory that holds all data for the resource
  * `'error'`: A Python stacktrace of any error that occured while running the resource's function
  * `'stdout`': A line-by-line log file of stdout produced by the resource's function (any `print()` calls)
  * `'stderr`': A line-by-line log of stderr messages printed by the resource's function (any `sys.stderr.write` calls)
  * `'status'`: a JSON object of status keys for the resource ("completed", "pending", "error")
  * `'result'`: Any JSON serializable data returned by the resource's function
  * `'storage'`: Additional storage for any files written by the resource's function
