This project implements an algorithm for inferring optimal binary decision trees classifiers.
It is scikit-learn compatible package which provide classifiers and clustering algorithms
and can be used with any scikit-learn functions. As any scikit-learn estimators, you have
to use methods "fit" and "predict".

This tool can be installed by two ways:

* download the sources from github and compile using the command ``python3 setup.py install`` in the root folder
* install from pip by using the command ``pip install dl8.5`` in your console

*Installation from sources ensure you to have up-to-date functionalities when* ``pip`` *method ensure you to have last release.*
