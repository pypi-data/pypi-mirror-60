# Homie

Python implementation of Homie 4.0.0

Class based system to easily add Homie 4.0.0 support to devices.

Supports the Meta, Statistics, and Firmware extensions

Install

~~~~
pip install Homie4
~~~~

Includes ready to use common devices such as switch, dimmer, contact, thermostat, boolean, etc. 


EG. To create a dimmer device requires that a set_dimmer method be provided. When creating a device, all that is required is to provide the MQTT settings. All other requirements of the Homie specification are automatically handled.

If creating multiple homie devices, you can specify Homie to only use one MQTT connection. This can be an issue on devices with limited resources. For MQTT_SETTINGS add MQTT_SHARE_CLIENT: True.
