# RAMSLIBS 
## Useful tools for working with RAMS data

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ramslibs/badge/?version=latest)](https://ramslibs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

RAMSlibs is in active development, lots of bugs probably still exist. If you find one, please create an issue on GitHub.

RAMSlibs strives to fix some of the frustrations encountered when working with [RAMS Model](https://vandenheever.atmos.colostate.edu/vdhpage/rams.php) data. This is by no means an exhaustive list, just issues I found myself working around time and time again in my own research.
