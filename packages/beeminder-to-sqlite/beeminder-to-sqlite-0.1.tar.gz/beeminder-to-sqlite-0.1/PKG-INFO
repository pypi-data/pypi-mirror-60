        Save data from [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) to a SQLite database.
        Supports saving goal data and data points.
        
        ## How to install
        
            $ pip install beeminder-to-sqlite
        
        ## Authentication
        
        Run the following command and enter your beeminder personal auth token:
        
            $ beeminder-to-sqlite auth
        
        This will create a file called `auth.json` in your current directory containing
        the required value. To save the file at a different path or filename, use the
        `--auth=myauth.json` option.
        
        ## Usage
        
        After you've setup your authentication, you can use the following commend to
        download and save your Beeminder data:
        
            $ beeminder-to-sqlite goals beeminder.db
        
        More detailed help can be found by running the command with `--help`
        
            $ beeminder-to-sqlite --help
