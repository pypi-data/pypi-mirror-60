about poetry-publish
====================

Helper to build and upload a project that used poetry to PyPi, with prechecks:

* User must confirm:

    * If ``__version__`` contains 'dev' or 'rc'

    * If git repository is not on ``master``

* Abort publish if git repository contains changes

* Abort if git repository is not up-to-date

* Abort if ``poetry check`` fails

* Abort if git version tag already exists

After a successfull upload to PyPi:

* create a git version tag

* git push tag to remote server

Compatible Python Versions (see `tox.ini <https://github.com/jedie/poetry-publish/blob/master/tox.ini>`_ or `.travis.yml <https://github.com/jedie/poetry-publish/blob/master/.travis.yml>`_):

* 3.8, 3.7, 3.6

* PyPy3

usage
-----

Create a publish hook in you project, e.g. create ``your_project/publish.py`` with:

::

    from pathlib import Path
    
    import your_project
    from poetry_publish.publish import poetry_publish
    
    
    def publish():
        poetry_publish(
            package_root=Path(your_project.__file__).parent.parent,
            version=your_project.__version__,
        )

Add this to your poetry ``pyproject.toml``, e.g.:

::

    [tool.poetry.scripts]
    publish = 'your_project:publish'

To publish do this:

::

    ~$ cd your_project
    ~/your_project$ poetry run publish

**Note:** Don't miss the ``run`` ! It's not the same as ``poetry publish``

based on:
`https://github.com/jedie/python-code-snippets/blob/master/CodeSnippets/setup_publish.py <https://github.com/jedie/python-code-snippets/blob/master/CodeSnippets/setup_publish.py>`_

---------
unittests
---------

::

    # clone repository (or use your fork):
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/jedie/poetry-publish.git
    ~$ cd poetry-publish
    
    # install or update poetry:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make install-poetry
    
    # install poetry-publish via poetry:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make install
    
    # Run pytest:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make pytest
    
    # Run pytest via tox with all environments:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make tox
    
    # Run pytest via tox with one Python version:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make tox-py38
    ~/poetry-publish$ make tox-py37
    ~/poetry-publish$ make tox-py36

------------
make targets
------------

To see all make targets, just call ``make``:

::

    ~/poetry-publish$ make
    help                 List all commands
    install-poetry       install or update poetry
    install              install poetry-publish via poetry
    lint                 Run code formatters and linter
    fix-code-style       Fix code formatting
    tox-listenvs         List all tox test environments
    tox                  Run pytest via tox with all environments
    tox-py36             Run pytest via tox with *python v3.6*
    tox-py37             Run pytest via tox with *python v3.7*
    tox-py38             Run pytest via tox with *python v3.8*
    pytest               Run pytest
    update-rst-readme    update README.rst from README.creole
    publish              Release new version to PyPi
