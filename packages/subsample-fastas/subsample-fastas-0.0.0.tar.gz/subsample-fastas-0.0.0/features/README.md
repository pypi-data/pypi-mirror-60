# Behavioral features for codon context

These scenarios define project requirements using a [Behavior-Driven Development](https://web.archive.org/web/20150901151029/http://behaviourdriven.org/) (BDD) style. Each feature is specified using natural [Gherkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#Behavioral_specifications) language.

The steps that are used in these specifications are defined in the [functional test](../../tests/functional/) files.
