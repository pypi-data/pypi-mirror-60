Special inspiration
-------------------

Reg is heavily inspired by ``zope.interface`` and ``zope.component``,
by Jim Fulton and a lot of Zope developers. It is also inspired by
Pyramid's view predicate system.

Thanks also to Chris McDonough who showed the way, reimplementing code
to make it better.

See also doc/history.rst for a more detailed history of its development.
