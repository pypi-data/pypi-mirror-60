Description: # Agape Auth
        
        The auth package provides a User model and an API for authenticating and registering users. It includes an account recovery API for resetting passwords and the User model can be extended dynamically.
        
        
        ## Quick start
        
        
        1. Add the desired applications into the INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'agape.authentication',
            ]
        
        2. Include the URLconf in your project urls.py like this:
        
            url(r'^/api/, include('agape.authentication.urls')),
        
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate agapeAuth` to create the models.
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/
        
        
        ## Developer Instructions
        
        ### Testing
        
        There are 3 different `runtests_*.py` files. Each one runs tests using a different configuration file. There is also a `runtests.sh` file which will run all all of the `runtests_*.py` files.
        
        
        ```
        ./runtests.sh
        
        venv/bin/python runtests_default.py
        
        ...
        ```
        
        ### Packaging & Distribution
        
        Instead of calling `python setup.py sdist` directly use the `build.sh` script. This script sets the version number in setup.py, builds the package, and releases to the loca repository if the `$REPO` variable is set.
        
        ```
        ./build.sh
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        pip install agape-auth
