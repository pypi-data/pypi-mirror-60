    "## Loading Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To train your network you first need to load your training data (and probably also your validation data). This chapter will therefore deal with `delira`'s capabilities to load your data (and apply some augmentation). \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "There are mainly two ways to load your data: Lazy or non-lazy. Loading in a lazy way means that you load the data just in time and keep the used memory to a bare minimum. This has, however, the disadvantage that your loading function could be a bottleneck since all postponed operations may have to wait until the needed data samples are loaded. In a no-lazy way, one would preload all data to RAM before starting any other operations. This has the advantage that there cannot be a loading bottleneck during latter operations. This advantage comes at cost of a higher memory usage and a (possibly) huge latency at the beginning of each experiment. Both ways to load your data are implemented in `delira` and they are named `BaseLazyDataset`and `BaseCacheDataset`. In the following steps you will only see the `BaseLazyDataset` since exchanging them is trivial. All Datasets (including the ones you might want to create yourself later) must be derived of `delira.data_loading.AbstractDataset` to ensure a minimum common API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset's `__init__` has the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self, data_path, load_fn, **load_kwargs):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means, you have to pass the path to the directory containing your data (`data_path`), a function to load a single sample of your data (`load_fn`). To get a single sample of your dataset after creating it, you can index it like this: `dataset[0]`.\n",
    "Additionally you can iterate over your dataset just like over any other `python` iterator via\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for sample in dataset:\n",
    "    # do your stuff here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or enumerate it via\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for idx, sample in enumerate(dataset):\n",
    "    # do your stuff here\n",
    "```\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "The missing argument `**load_kwargs` accepts an arbitrary amount of additional keyword arguments which are directly passed to your loading function.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of how loading your data may look like is given below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from delira.data_loading import BaseLazyDataset, default_load_fn_2d\n",
    "dataset_train = BaseLazyDataset(\"/images/datasets/external/mnist/train\",\n",
    "                                default_load_fn_2d, img_shape=(224, 224))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case all data lying in `/images/datasets/external/mnist/train` is loaded by `default_load_fn_2d`. The files containing the data must be PNG-files, while the groundtruth is defined in TXT-files. The `default_load_fn_2d` needs the additional argument `img_shape` which is passed as keyword argument via `**load_kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** for reproducability we decided to use some wrapped PyTorch datasets for this introduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's just initialize our trainset:"

    "The `AbstractSampler` implements no sampling algorithm but defines a sampling API and thus all custom samplers must inherit from this class. The `Sequential` sampler builds batches by just iterating over the samples' indices in a sequential way. Following this, the `RandomSampler` builds batches by randomly drawing the samples' indices with replacement. \n",
    "If the class each sample belongs to is known for each sample at the beginning, the `PrevalenceSequentialSampler` and the `PrevalenceRandomSampler` perform a per-class sequential or random sampling and building each batch with the exactly same number of samples from each class. \n",

    "The `closure`function defines one batch iteration to train the network. This function is needed for the framework to provide a generic trainer function which works with all kind of networks and loss functions.\n",

    "The closure function must implement all steps from forwarding, over loss calculation, metric calculation, logging (for which `delira.logging_handlers` provides some extensions for pythons logging module), and the actual backpropagation.\n",

    "### PyTorch\n",
    "At the time of writing, PyTorch is the only backend which is supported, but other backends are planned.\n",
    "In PyTorch every network should be implemented as a subclass of `torch.nn.Module`, which also provides a `__call__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in sloghtly different requirements for PyTorch networks: instead of implementing a `__call__` method, we simply call the `torch.nn.Module.__call__` and therefore have to implement the `forward` method, which defines the module's behaviour and is internally called by `torch.nn.Module.__call__` (among other stuff). To give a default behaviour suiting most cases and not have to care about internals, `delira` provides the `AbstractPyTorchNetwork` which is a more specific case of the `AbstractNetwork` for PyTorch modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `forward`\n",
    "The `forward` function defines what has to be done to forward your input through your network and must return a dictionary. Assuming your network has three convolutional layers stored in `self.conv1`, `self.conv2` and `self.conv3` and a ReLU stored in `self.relu`, a simple `forward` function could look like this:\n",
