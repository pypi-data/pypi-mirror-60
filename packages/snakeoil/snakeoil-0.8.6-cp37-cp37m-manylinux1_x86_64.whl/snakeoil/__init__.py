snakeoil library

This library is a bit of a grabbag of the following:

* implementations that make nasty/hard problems simple in usage
* standard lib fixups; a new style UserDict base class for example that
  is designed around iter* overriding, rather than sequence methods as
  UserDict is.
* python version compatibility; snakeoil supports 3.4 through 3.7,
  exposing fallback implementations of desirable functionality in older python
  versions.
* optimized implementations of common patterns
