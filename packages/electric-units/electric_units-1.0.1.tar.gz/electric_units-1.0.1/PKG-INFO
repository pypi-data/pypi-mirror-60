        ## Installation
        
        `pip install electric-units` will install from pypi
        
        Or, you can view or checkout the source from [Github](https://github.com/ample-tech/electric-units) and `python setup.py install` will install the package and its
        dependancies.
        
        ## Development
        This has come of the needs we keep running into when dealing with data from
        electricity systems - if you find these useful and want to change or add to
        the units, please do!
        
        If you've never contributed to open source before - even better. We are here
        to help you make your first PR and will make an effort to create and reserve
        issue for [first timers only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com).
