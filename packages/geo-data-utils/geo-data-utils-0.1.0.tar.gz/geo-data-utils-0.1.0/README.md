install from pypi

```
pip install geo-data-utils
```

Install direct from git

```

Or clone the repo so you can make changes or view the code, note the -e in the pip install is optional, it makes it so any code changes are automatically picked up.

git clone https://gitlab.com/csiro-geoanalytics/python-shared/geo-data-utils.git
<Navigate to the code directory>
pip install -e .
```

If you would like to work on the code in a virtual env a pipfile is available

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
