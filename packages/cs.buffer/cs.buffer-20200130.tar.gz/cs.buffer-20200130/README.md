*Latest release 20200130*:
CornuCopyBuffer.skip: bugfix adjustment of skipto for already buffered data.

Facilities to do with buffers, particularly CornuCopyBuffer,
an automatically refilling buffer to support parsing of data streams.

## Function `chunky(bfr_func)`

Decorator for a function accepting a leading `CornuCopyBuffer`
parameter.
Returns a function accepting a leading data chunks parameter
(bytes instances) and optional `offset` and 'copy_offsets`
keywords parameters.

Example::

    @chunky
    def func(bfr, ...):

## Class `CopyingIterator`

Wrapper for an iterator that copies every item retrieved to a callable.

### Method `CopyingIterator.__init__(self, I, copy_to)`

Initialise with the iterator `I` and the callable `copy_to`.

## Class `CornuCopyBuffer`

An automatically refilling buffer intended to support parsing
of data streams.

Its purpose is to aid binary parsers
which do not themselves need to handle sources specially;
`CornuCopyBuffer`s are trivially made from `bytes`,
iterables of `bytes` and file-like objects.
See `cs.binary` for convenient parsing classes
which work against `CornuCopyBuffer`s.

Attributes:
* `buf`: the first of any buffered leading chunks
  buffer of unparsed data from the input, available
  for direct inspection by parsers;
  normally however parsers will use `.extend` and `.take`.
* `offset`: the logical offset of the buffer; this excludes
  buffered data and unconsumed input data

The primary methods supporting parsing of data streams are
`.extend()` and `take()`.
Calling `.extend(min_size)` arranges that `.buf` contains at least
`min_size` bytes.
Calling `.take(size)` fetches exactly `size` bytes from `.buf` and the
input source if necessary and returns them, adjusting `.buf`.

len(`CornuCopyBuffer`) returns the length of any buffered data.

bool(`CornuCopyBuffer`) tests whether len() > 0.

Indexing a `CornuCopyBuffer` accesses the buffered data only,
returning an individual byte's value (an `int`).

A `CornuCopyBuffer` is also iterable, yielding data in whatever
sizes come from its `input_data` source, preceeded by the
current `.buf` if not empty.

A `CornuCopyBuffer` also supports the file methods `.read`,
`.tell` and `.seek` supporting drop in use of the buffer in
many file contexts. Backward seeks are not supported. `.seek`
will take advantage of the `input_data`'s .seek method if it
has one, otherwise it will use reads.

### Method `CornuCopyBuffer.__init__(self, input_data, buf=None, offset=0, seekable=None, copy_offsets=None, copy_chunks=None)`

Prepare the buffer.

Parameters:
* `input_data`: an iterable of data chunks (bytes-like instances);
  if your data source is a file see the .from_file factory;
  if your data source is a file descriptor see the .from_fd
  factory.
* `buf`: if not `None`, the initial state of the parse buffer
* `offset`: logical offset of the start of the buffer, default 0
* `seekable`: whether `input_data` has a working `.seek` method;
  the default is None meaning that it will be attempted on
  the first skip or seek
* `copy_offsets`: if not `None`, a callable for parsers to
  report pertinent offsets via the buffer's .report_offset
  method
* `copy_chunks`: if not `None`, every fetched data chunk is
  copied to this callable

The `input_data` is an iterable whose iterator may have
some optional additional properties:
* `seek`: if present, this is a seek method after the fashion
  of `file.seek`; the buffer's `seek`, `skip` and `skipto`
  methods will take advantage of this if available.
* `offset`: the current byte offset of the iterator; this
  is used during the buffer initialisation to compute
  `input_data_displacement`, the difference between the
  buffer's logical offset and the input data's logical offset;
  if unavailable during initialisation this is presumed to
  be `0`.
* `end_offset`: the end offset of the iterator if known.

## Class `FDIterator(_Iterator)`

An iterator over the data of a file descriptor.

*Note*: the iterator works with an os.dup() of the file
descriptor so that it can close it with impunity; this requires
the caller to close their descriptor.

### Method `FDIterator.__init__(self, fd, offset=None, readsize=None, align=True)`

Initialise the iterator.

Parameters:
* `fd`: file descriptor
* `offset`: the initial logical offset, kept up to date by
  iteration; the default is the current file position.
* `readsize`: a preferred read size; if omitted then
  `DEFAULT_READSIZE` will be stored
* `align`: whether to align reads by default: if true then
  the iterator will do a short read to bring the `offset`
  into alignment with `readsize`; the default is `True`

## Class `FileIterator(_Iterator,SeekableIteratorMixin)`

An iterator over the data of a file object.

*Note*: the iterator closes the file on `__del__` or if its
`.close` method is called.

### Method `FileIterator.__init__(self, fp, offset=None, readsize=None, align=False)`

Initialise the iterator.

Parameters:
* `fp`: file object
* `offset`: the initial logical offset, kept up to date by
  iteration; the default is 0.
* `readsize`: a preferred read size; if omitted then
  `DEFAULT_READSIZE` will be stored
* `align`: whether to align reads by default: if true then
  the iterator will do a short read to bring the `offset`
  into alignment with `readsize`; the default is `False`

## Class `SeekableFDIterator(FDIterator,_Iterator,SeekableIteratorMixin)`

An iterator over the data of a seekable file descriptor.

*Note*: the iterator works with an `os.dup()` of the file
descriptor so that it can close it with impunity; this requires
the caller to close their descriptor.

## Class `SeekableFileIterator(FileIterator,_Iterator,SeekableIteratorMixin)`

An iterator over the data of a seekable file object.

*Note*: the iterator closes the file on __del__ or if its
.close method is called.

### Method `SeekableFileIterator.__init__(self, fp, offset=None, **kw)`

Initialise the iterator.

Parameters:
* `fp`: file object
* `offset`: the initial logical offset, kept up to date by
  iteration; the default is the current file position.
* `readsize`: a preferred read size; if omitted then
  `DEFAULT_READSIZE` will be stored
* `align`: whether to align reads by default: if true then
  the iterator will do a short read to bring the `offset`
  into alignment with `readsize`; the default is `False`

## Class `SeekableIteratorMixin`

Mixin supplying a logical with a `seek` method.

## Class `SeekableMMapIterator(_Iterator,SeekableIteratorMixin)`

An iterator over the data of a mappable file descriptor.

*Note*: the iterator works with an `mmap` of an `os.dup()` of the
file descriptor so that it can close it with impunity; this
requires the caller to close their descriptor.

### Method `SeekableMMapIterator.__init__(self, fd, offset=None, readsize=None, align=True)`

Initialise the iterator.

Parameters:
* `offset`: the initial logical offset, kept up to date by
  iteration; the default is the current file position.
* `readsize`: a preferred read size; if omitted then
  `DEFAULT_READSIZE` will be stored
* `align`: whether to align reads by default: if true then
  the iterator will do a short read to bring the `offset`
  into alignment with `readsize`; the default is `True`



# Release Log

*Release 20200130*:
CornuCopyBuffer.skip: bugfix adjustment of skipto for already buffered data.

*Release 20191230.1*:
Docstring updates. Semantic changes were in the previous release.

*Release 20191230*:
CornuCopyBuffer: accept a size of Ellipsis in .take and .extend methods, indicating "all the remaining data".
CornuCopyBuffer: refactor the buffering, replacing .buf with .bufs as an array of chunks;
this enables support for the new .push method and reduces memory copying.

*Release 20181231*:
Small bugfix.

*Release 20181108*:
New at_eof() method. Python 2 tweak to support incidental import by python 2 even if unused.

*Release 20180823*:
Better handling of seekable and unseekable input data. Tiny bugfix for from_bytes sanity check.

*Release 20180810*:
Refactor SeekableFDIterator and SeekableFileIterator to subclass new SeekableIterator.
New SeekableMMapIterator to process a memory mapped file descriptor, intended for large files.
New CornuCopyBuffer.hint method to pass a length hint through to the input_data iterator
if it has a `hint` method, causing it possibly to make a differently sized fetch.
SeekableIterator: new __del__ method calling self.close() - subclasses must provide
a .close, which should be safe to call multiple times.
CornuCopyBuffer: add support for .offset and .end_offset optional attributes on the input_data iterator.
_BoundedBufferIterator: add .offset property plumbed to the underlying buffer offset.
New CornuCopyBuffer.from_mmap to make a mmap backed buffer so that large data can be returned without penalty.
Assorted fixes and doc improvements.

*Release 20180805*:
Bugfixes for at_eof method and end_offset initialisation.

*Release 20180726.1*:
Improve docstrings and release with better long_description.

*Release 20180726*:
First PyPI release: CornuCopyBuffer and friends.
