# Tiny 3D Engine

This package ais a 3D engine for Tkinter Canvas.
It uses Numpy for math handling.

It is a mix between a Pure Tcl/Tk Engine of mine [pureTK 3d engine](https://gitlab.com/cerfacs/opentea/blob/1.7/c3sm/create_viewer3d.tcl) and the the pyEngine3D-master of [henryHaefliger](https://github.com/hnhaefliger)[pyEngine3D](https://github.com/hnhaefliger/PyEngine3D)

The present one allow several parts to be loaded, and uses numpy.
Scenes can be dumped or read from the Ensifgr .case/.geo files.
