    The present class is essentially a field_map.FieldMapSliceWise with
    a pre-filled Bassetti-Erskine formula computed field map
    (cf. spacecharge.TransverseGaussianSpaceCharge).
    The same electric transverse field is applied to all slices while
    being multiplied by the local line charge density [Coul/m].
    In particular, this means that the strength of the local field is
    self-consistent in the longitudinal plane but frozen in the
    transverse plane (with the fixed Gaussian electric field).

    This frozen space charge model essentially acts equivalently to an
    external magnet and fails to provide self-consistent treatment of
    space charge related effects like quadrupolar envelope breathing
    etc. Also the sum of all kicks does not vanish resulting in a net
    kick for the centroid as opposed to the SpaceChargePIC treatment.

    FrozenGaussianSpaceCharge25D can continuously recompute and update
    the fields during tracking of the beam if a relative change of the
    beam RMS sizes is fixed via the argument sigma_rtol. If sigma_rtol
    is None, the stored fields are not updated and remain constant.
