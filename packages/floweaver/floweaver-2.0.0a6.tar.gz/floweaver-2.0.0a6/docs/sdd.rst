Sankey diagram definitions
==========================

Sankey diagram definitions (SDDs) describe the structure of the Sankey diagram
you want to end up with. They are *declarative*: you declare what you want up
front, but the diagram isn't created until later. This is useful if you want to
use the same diagram structure for different data sources.
