Welcome to floweaver's documentation!
=======================================

.. image:: floweaver_overview.png

floWeaver generates Sankey diagrams from a dataset of flows. For a descriptive
introduction, see the paper `Hybrid Sankey diagrams: Visual analysis of
multidimensional data for understanding resource use
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.05.002>`_. For a more hands-on
introduction, read on.
