MICtools is an open source pipeline which combines the
TIC_e and MIC_e measures into a two-step procedure that allows to
identify relationships of various degrees of complexity in large datasets. TIC_e
is used to perform efficiently a high throughput screening of all the possible
pairwise relationships assessing their significance, while MIC_e is used to rank 
the subset of significant associations on the bases of their strength. Homepage:
