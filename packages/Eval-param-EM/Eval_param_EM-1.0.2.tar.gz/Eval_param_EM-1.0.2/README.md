Evaluating the performance of ML Models 

# Evaluation-Parameters-for-ML-models
Collecetion of Basic Parameters like accuaracy etc for evaluating the models 

# Model Evaluation
Model evaluation aims to estimate the generalization accuracy of a model on future (unseen/out-of-sample) data. Where we have different techniques to predict the data, its accuracy and other evaluation parameters helps in selecting the best ML Algorithm to be used.
