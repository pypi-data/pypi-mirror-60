## How to use

### Type checking

Make sure you have [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) installed and activated in your IDE.

Install `boto3-stubs` for `Health` service.

```bash
python -m pip install boto3-stubs[mypy-boto3-health]
```

Use `boto3` with `mypy_boto3` in your project and enjoy type checking and auto-complete.

```python
import boto3

from mypy_boto3 import health
# alternative import if you do not want to install mypy_boto3 package
# import mypy_boto3_health as health

# Use this client as usual, now mypy can check if your code is valid.
# Check if your IDE supports function overloads,
# you probably do not need explicit type annotations
# client = boto3.client("health")
client: health.HealthClient = boto3.client("health")

# works for session as well
session = boto3.session.Session(region="us-west-1")
session_client: health.HealthClient = session.client("health")


# Paginators need type annotation on creation
describe_affected_accounts_for_organization_paginator: health.DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganizationPaginator = client.get_paginator("describe_affected_accounts_for_organization")
describe_affected_entities_paginator: health.DescribeAffectedEntitiesPaginator = client.get_paginator("describe_affected_entities")
describe_affected_entities_for_organization_paginator: health.DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganizationPaginator = client.get_paginator("describe_affected_entities_for_organization")
describe_event_aggregates_paginator: health.DescribeEventAggregatesPaginator = client.get_paginator("describe_event_aggregates")
describe_event_types_paginator: health.DescribeEventTypesPaginator = client.get_paginator("describe_event_types")
describe_events_paginator: health.DescribeEventsPaginator = client.get_paginator("describe_events")
describe_events_for_organization_paginator: health.DescribeEventsForOrganizationPaginator = client.get_paginator("describe_events_for_organization")
```

## How it works

Fully automated [builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3) carefully generates
type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3` updates. It delivers
a drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:

- All available `boto3` services are covered.
- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type annotations
  extracted from the documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types are incorrect).
- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
- Link to documentation is provided for every method.
- Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for readability.
