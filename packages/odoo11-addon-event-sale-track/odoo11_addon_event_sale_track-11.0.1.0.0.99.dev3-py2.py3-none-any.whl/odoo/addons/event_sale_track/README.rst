Move ticket relation to the tracks allowing to
manage event subscriptions by tracks.

The typical use case are:

* you have an event with multiple workshops and you have enough space
  but the size of the workshops needs to be limited to be managable

* you have different prices per each track

Note that default relations are preserved by proxying them over the Track model,
so those apps which are based on the default behaviour will work without issues.

Usage
=====

All interfaces for creating tickets have been moved away from the event to the Tracks.

![Track view](../images/track_view.png)

If this module is installed all the created tracks
will automatically create a default Ticket for themselves.

Of course it also can be used as a base for further development.

If `website_event_tickets` is installed
the track tickets are displayed like normal tickets would be too.
There is currently no custom integration with the website side of odoo though.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Make sure a user can't sign up for a event twice;
* Allow to limit the Participants on track and event level.
  Currently it is only handled by ticket;
* Block seats management at event level if you are managing them at track level;
* Integration with website module.
