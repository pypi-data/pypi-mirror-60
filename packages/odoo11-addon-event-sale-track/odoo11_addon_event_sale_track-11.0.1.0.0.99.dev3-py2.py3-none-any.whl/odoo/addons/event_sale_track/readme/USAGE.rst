All interfaces for creating tickets have been moved away from the event to the Tracks.

If this module is installed all the created tracks
will automatically create a default Ticket for themselves.

Of course it also can be used as a base for further development.

If `website_event_tickets` is installed
the track tickets are displayed like normal tickets would be too.
There is currently no custom integration with the website side of odoo though.
