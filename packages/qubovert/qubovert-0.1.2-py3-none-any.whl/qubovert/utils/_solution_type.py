"""_solution_type.py.

This file contains the function ``solution_type`` which takes in a solution and
determines if it is known whether the solution came from a binary or spin
formultion.

"""


__all__ = 'solution_type',


def solution_type(solution):
    """solution_type.

    Figure out if the ``solution`` is a solution to a binary or a spin model.
    If it cannot be determined (ie if ``solution`` is all 1s), then return
    ``None``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    solution : dict or iterable.
        Either a dictionary that maps variable names to values, or an iterable
        with values. If ``solution`` is a bin type, then all the values should
        be either a 0 or 1. If ``solution`` is a spin type, then all the values
        should be either a 1 or -1.

    Returns
    -------
    res : str.
        If it is determined that ``solution`` is the solution to a spin model,
        then ``res`` will be ``'spin'``. If it is determined that ``solution``
        is the solution to a binary model, then `res`` will be ``'bin'``.
        Otherwise, ``res`` will be ``None``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> solution_type((0, 1, 1, 0))
    'bin'

    >>> solution_type((1, -1, -1, 1))
    'spin'

    >>> solution_type((1, 1, 1, 1))
    None
