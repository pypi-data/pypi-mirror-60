class Ising(BO, IsingMatrix):
    """Ising.

    Class to manage converting general Ising problems to and from their
    QUBO and Ising formluations.

    This class deals with Isings that have binary labels that do not range from
    0 to n-1. If your labels are nonnegative integers, consider using
    ``qubovert.utils.IsingMatrix``. Note that it is generally
    more efficient to initialize an empty Ising object and then build the
    Ising, rather than initialize a Ising object with an already built dict.

    Ising inherits some methods and attributes the ``IsingMatrix`` class. See
    ``help(qubovert.utils.IsingMatrix)``.

    Example usage
    -------------
    >>> ising = Ising()
    >>> ising[('a',)] += 5
    >>> ising[(0, 'a')] -= 2
    >>> ising -= 1.5
    >>> ising
    {('a',): 5, ('a', 0): -2, (): -1.5}

    >>> ising = Ising({('a',): 5, (0, 'a'): -2, (): -1.5})
    >>> ising
    {('a',): 5, ('a', 0): -2, (): -1.5}
    >>> L = ising.to_ising()
    >>> L
    {(0,): 5, (0, 1): -2, (): -1.5}
    >>> ising.convert_solution({0: 1, 1: 0})
    {'a': 1, 0: 0}

    Note 1
    ------
    Note that keys will end up sorted by their hash. Hashes will not be
    consistent across Python sessions (unless they are integers)! For example,
    both of the following can happen:

    >>> print(Ising({('a', 0): 1, (0, 1): -1}))
    {('a', 0): 1, (0, 1): -1}

    or

    >>> print(Ising({('a', 0): 1, (0, 1): -1}))
    {(0, 'a'): 1, (0, 1): -1}

    But the following will never happen:

    >>> print(Ising({('a', 0): 1, (0, 1): -1}))
    {('a', 0): 1, (1, 0): -1}

    Ie integers will always be correctly sorted.

    Note 2
    ------
    For efficiency, many internal variables including mappings are computed as
    the problemis being built. This can cause these
    values to be wrong for some specific situations. Calling ``refresh``
    will rebuild the dictionary, resetting all of the values. See
    ``help(Ising.refresh)``

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from qubovert import Ising
    >>> L = Ising()
    >>> L[('a',)] += 1
    >>> L, L.mapping, L.reverse_mapping
    {('a',): 1}, {'a': 0}, {0: 'a'}
    >>> L[('a',)] -= 1
    >>> L, L.mapping, L.reverse_mapping
    {}, {'a': 0}, {0: 'a'}
    >>> L.refresh()
    >>> L, L.mapping, L.reverse_mapping
    {}, {}, {}

    def convert_solution(self, solution, spin=True):
        """convert_solution.

        Convert the solution to the integer labeled Ising to the solution to
        the originally labeled Ising.

        Parameters
        ----------
        solution : iterable or dict.
            The QUBO or Ising solution output. The Ising solution output
            is either a list or tuple where indices specify the label of the
            variable and the element specifies whether it's 0 or 1 for QUBO
            (or 1 or -1 for Ising), or it can be a dictionary that maps the
            label of the variable to is value.
        spin : bool (optional, defaults to True).
            `spin` indicates whether ``solution`` is the solution to the
            binary {0, 1} formulation of the problem or the spin {1, -1}
            formulation of the problem. This parameter usually does not matter,
            and it will be ignored if possible. The only time it is used is if
            ``solution`` contains all 1's. In this case, it is unclear whether
            ``solution`` came from a spin or binary formulation of the
            problem, and we will figure it out based on the ``spin`` parameter.

        Return
        -------
        res : dict.
            Maps binary variable labels to their Ising solutions values {0, 1}.
