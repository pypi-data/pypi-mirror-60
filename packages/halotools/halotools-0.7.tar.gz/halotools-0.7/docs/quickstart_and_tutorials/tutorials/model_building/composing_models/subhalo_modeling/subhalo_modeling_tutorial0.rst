.. currentmodule:: halotools.empirical_models

This section of the documentation describes how you can  
build a custom-designed subhalo-based model of the galaxy-halo connection. 
This material is most easily learned by way of example, and so 
the remainder of the tutorial is organized into a sequence 
of worked examples of increasing complexity.
