Tutorials on analyzing halo catalogs 
**********************************************************************

By following these tutorials, you will learn how to use Halotools to 
analyze a halo catalog. Each of the examples below is in principle stand-alone, 
so that you can pick and choose from any of the pages below according to 
the kind of analysis you are most interested in. 
In cases where material covered in a previous example is necessary 
to understand some aspect of one of the more complicated later calculations, 
a link to the previous example will always be provided. 

Basic examples
===================
Each of the examples in this section gives a specific demonstration of how to perform a 
straightforward calculation on a halo catalog. By reading through 
these examples, you will gain a working knowledge of all the major functions 
in the `~halotools.mock_observables` package.
