Tutorial on the mock-making algorithms 
***************************************

This section of the documentation gives a detailed explanation of 
the Halotools algorithm for making mock galaxy catalogs. Because of differences 
in memory allocation, HOD-style mocks are generated with a significantly 
different algorithm than subhalo-based mocks, and so there are separate tutorials 
for those two mock-making factory classes:
:ref:`hod_mock_factory_source_notes` and :ref:`subhalo_mock_factory_source_notes`, respectively. 

Both tutorials are dense as they cover all aspects of the Halotools source code 
implementing mock-making. If you are instead just looking for information on how to 
build an HOD-style or subhalo-based model, instead refer to the 
:ref:`model_building` section of the documentation.
