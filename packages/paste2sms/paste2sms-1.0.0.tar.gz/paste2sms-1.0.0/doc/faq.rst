How can I send a SMS to someone else?
-------------------------------------

You cannot. My cell phone providers provides an API to send free SMS to myself. Then, on my smarthone, I copy-paste SMS to its recipient.

Does it work on Windows or MacOS?
---------------------------------

No. But most of ``paste2sms`` is portable (the main part that is not is the notification system):
