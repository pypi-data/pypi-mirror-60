# ProxyCrawl API middleware for Scrapy

Processes [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) requests using [ProxyCrawl](https://proxycrawl.com) services either with Normal or Javascript tokens


## Installing

Choose a way of installing:

- Clone the repository inside your Scrapy project and run the following:
```bash
python setup.py install
```
- Or use [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/scrapy-proxycrawl-middleware/) Python package manager. `pip install scrapy-proxycrawl-middleware`

Then in your Scrapy `settings.py` add the following lines:

```python
# Activate the middleware
PROXYCRAWL_ENABLED = True

# The ProxyCrawl API token you wish to use, either normal of javascript token
PROXYCRAWL_TOKEN = 'your token'

# Enable the middleware
DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'scrapy_proxycrawl.ProxyCrawlMiddleware': 610
}
```
## Usage

Use the scrapy_proxycrawl.ProxyCrawlRequest instead of the scrapy built-in Request.
The scrapy_proxycrawl.ProxyCrawlRequest accepts additional arguments, used in Proxy Crawl API:

```python
from scrapy_proxycrawl import ProxyCrawlRequest

yield ProxyCrawlRequest(
    "http://target-url",
    callback=self.parse_result
    device='desktop',
    country='US',
    page_wait=1000,
    ajax_wait=True,
    dont_filter=True
)
```

The target url will be replaced with proxy crawl url and parameters will be encoded into the url by the middleware automatically.
