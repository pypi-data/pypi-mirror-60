Description: FATSLiM (Fast Analysis Toolbox for Simulations of Lipid Membranes and its goal
         is to provide an efficient, yet robust, tool to extract physical parameters from MD trajectories.
        
        The main objective of FATSLiM is to decrease as possible the amount of time needed to
        analyze MD trajectories: the ultimate goal is to process a several-gigabyte-big file is just a
        few minutes or less. This is why a rather important part of FATSLiM's development is
        focused on code optimization and simplification in order to maximize its efficiency.
