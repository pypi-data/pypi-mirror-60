        ## About
        This library is designed to fill gaps between other libraries with the JupyterLab ecosystem. The motivation was initially to allow for plots generated with a javascript library (like `plotly` or `bokeh`) to trivially swap out for `matplotlib` in non-browser contexts such as NBConvert generation of PDFs. 
        
        It has expanded to include a variety of functions, including grids, emailing notebooks, publishing notebooks, custom nbconvert exporters for JupyterLab, variable inpection, custom streaming operations, and other helpful functions and widgets. As these functionalities mature, or as competeting libraries emerge, they are cut out into their own standalone libraries or removed from `Lantern`, respectively. 
        
        This library has produced or ceded functionality to:
        - [jupyterlab_email](https://github.com/timkpaine/https://github.com/timkpaine/jupyterlab_email)
        - [tributary](https://github.com/timkpaine/tributary)
        - [jupyterlab_commands](https://github.com/timkpaine/jupyterlab_commands/)
        - [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila)
        
        ## Install
        To install the base package from pip:
        
        `pip install pylantern`
        
        To Install from source:
        
        `make install`
        
        
        Lantern relies on JupyterLab extensions:
        
        ```
        jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
        jupyter labextension install plotlywidget
        jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/plotly-extension
        jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_bokeh
        jupyter labextension install qgrid
        jupyter labextension install @jpmorganchase/perspective-jupyterlab
        jupyter labextension install ipysheet
        jupyter labextension install lineup_widget
        ```
        
        The following are for work in-progress on master:
        
        ```
        jupyter labextension install bqplot
        ```
