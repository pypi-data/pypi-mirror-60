AWS CodeCommit is a version control service that enables you to privately store and manage Git repositories in the AWS cloud.

For further information on CodeCommit,
see the [AWS CodeCommit documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit).

To add a CodeCommit Repository to your stack:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_codecommit as codecommit

repo = codecommit.Repository(self, "Repository",
    repository_name="MyRepositoryName",
    description="Some description."
)
```

To add an Amazon SNS trigger to your repository:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# trigger is established for all repository actions on all branches by default.
repo.notify("arn:aws:sns:*:123456789012:my_topic")
```

## Events

CodeCommit repositories emit Amazon CloudWatch events for certain activities.
Use the `repo.onXxx` methods to define rules that trigger on these events
and invoke targets as a result:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# starts a CodeBuild project when a commit is pushed to the "master" branch of the repo
repo.on_commit("CommitToMaster",
    target=targets.CodeBuildProject(project),
    branches=["master"]
)

# publishes a message to an Amazon SNS topic when a comment is made on a pull request
rule = repo.on_comment_on_pull_request("CommentOnPullRequest",
    target=targets.SnsTopic(my_topic)
)
```
