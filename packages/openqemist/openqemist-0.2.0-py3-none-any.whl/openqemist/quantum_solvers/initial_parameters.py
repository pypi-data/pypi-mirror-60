"""Prepare the initial amplitudes for quantum simulation.

The electronic structure calculation employing the
second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)
to prepare the initial T2 amplitudes is done here.

    """ Computes and prepares the MP2 inital amplitudes.

    Compute the inital amplitudes with PySCF MP2 calculation,
    and then reorders the elements into the QEMIST convention.

    MP2 only has doubles (T2) amplitudes, thus the single (T1) amplitudes
    are set to a small non-zero value and added.

    The ordering for QEMIST is single, double (diagonal), double (non-diagonal).

    Args:
        molecule (pyscf.gto.Mole): The molecule to simulate.
        mean_field (pyscf.scf.RHF): The mean field of the molecule.
