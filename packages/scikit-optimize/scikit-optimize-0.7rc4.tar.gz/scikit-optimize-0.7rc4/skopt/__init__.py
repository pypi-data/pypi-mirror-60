"""
Scikit-Optimize, or `skopt`, is a simple and efficient library to
minimize (very) expensive and noisy black-box functions. It implements
several methods for sequential model-based optimization. `skopt` is reusable
in many contexts and accessible.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize)

## Install

```
pip install scikit-optimize
```

## Getting started

Find the minimum of the noisy function `f(x)` over the range `-2 < x < 2`
with `skopt`:

```python
import numpy as np
from skopt import gp_minimize

def f(x):
    return (np.sin(5 * x[0]) * (1 - np.tanh(x[0] ** 2)) *
            np.random.randn() * 0.1)

res = gp_minimize(f, [(-2.0, 2.0)])
```

For more read our [introduction to bayesian optimization](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/notebooks/bayesian-optimization.html)
and the other [examples](https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize/tree/master/examples).


## Development

The library is still experimental and under heavy development.

The development version can be installed through:

    git clone https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize.git
    cd scikit-optimize
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop

Run the tests by executing `pytest` in the top level directory.
