Welcome to scikit-optimize's documentation!
===========================================

Scikit-Optimize, or ``skopt``, is a simple and efficient library to
minimize (very) expensive and noisy black-box functions. It implements
several methods for sequential model-based optimization. ``skopt`` aims
to be accessible and easy to use in many contexts.

The library is built on top of NumPy, SciPy and Scikit-Learn.

We do not perform gradient-based optimization. For gradient-based
optimization algorithms look at
``scipy.optimize``
`here <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html>`_.
