.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
KIWI is an imaging solution that is based on an image XML description.
Such a description is represented by a directory which includes at least
one \fBconfig.xml\fP or \fB\&.kiwi\fP file and may as well include other files like
scripts or configuration data.
.sp
A collection of example image descriptions can be found on the github
repository here: \fI\%https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi\-descriptions\fP\&. Most of the
descriptions provide a so called JeOS image. JeOS means Just enough
Operating System. A JeOS is a small, text only based image including a
predefined remote source setup to allow installation of missing
software components at a later point in time.
.sp
KIWI operates in two steps. The system build command combines
both steps into one to make it easier to start with KIWI. The first
step is the preparation step and if that step was successful, a
creation step follows which is able to create different image output
types.
.sp
In the preparation step, you prepare a directory including the contents
of your new filesystem based on one or more software package source(s)
The creation step is based on the result of the preparation step and
uses the contents of the new image root tree to create the output
image.
.sp
KIWI supports the creation of the following image types:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ISO Live Systems
.IP \(bu 2
Virtual Disk for e.g cloud frameworks
.IP \(bu 2
OEM Expandable Disk for system deployment from ISO or the network
.IP \(bu 2
File system images for deployment in a pxe boot environment
.UNINDENT
.sp
Depending on the image type a variety of different disk formats and
architectures are supported.
.SH GLOBAL OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-color\-output
Use Escape Sequences to print different types of information
in colored output. The underlaying terminal has to understand
those escape characters. Error messages appear red, warning
messages yellow and debugging information will be printed light
grey.
.TP
.B \-\-debug
Print debug information on the commandline.
.TP
.BI \-\-logfile\fB= <filename>
Specify log file. the logfile contains detailed information about
the process.
.TP
.BI \-\-profile\fB= <name>
Select profile to use. The specified profile must be part of the
XML description. The option can be specified multiple times to
allow using a combination of profiles
.TP
.BI \-\-shared\-cache\-dir\fB= <directory>
Specify an alternative shared cache directory. The directory
is shared via bind mount between the build host and image
root system and contains information about package repositories
and their cache and meta data. The default location is set
to /var/cache/kiwi
.TP
.BI \-\-type\fB= <build_type>
Select image build type. The specified build type must be configured
as part of the XML description.
.TP
.B \-\-version

.SH THE RUNTIME CONFIGURATION FILE
.sp
KIWI supports an additional configuration file for runtime specific
settings that do not belong into the image description but which are
persistent and would be unsuitable for command line parameters.
.sp
The runtime configuration file must adhere to the \fI\%YAML\fP syntax. KIWI searches for the runtime configuration
file in the following locations:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
\fB~/.config/kiwi/config.yml\fP
.IP 2. 3
\fB/etc/kiwi.yml\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The parameters that can be changed via the runtime configuration file are
illustrated in the following example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

xz:
  # Additional command line flags for \(gaxz\(ga
  # see \(gaman xz\(ga for details
  \- options: \-9e

obs:
  # Override the URL to the Open Build Service (i.e. how repository
  # paths starting with \(gaobs://\(ga will be resolved).
  # This setting is useful for building a KIWI appliance locally, which is
  # hosted on a custom OBS instance.
  # defaults to: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories
  \- download_url: https://build.my\-domain.example/repositories

  # Specifies whether the Open Build Service instance is public or
  # private
  # defaults to true
  \- public: true | false

bundle:
  # Configure whether the image bundle should contain a XZ compressed
  # image result or not.
  \- compress: true | false

container:
  # Specify the compression algorithm for compressing container
  # images. Invalid entries are skipped.
  # Defaults to \(gaxz\(ga.
  \- compress: xz | none

iso:
  # Configure which tool KIWI will use to build ISO images. Invalid
  # entries are ignored.
  # Defaults to \(gaxorriso\(ga
  \- tool_category: cdrtools | xorriso

oci:
  # Specify the OCI archive tool that will be used to create container
  # archives for OCI compliant images.
  # Defaults to \(gaumoci\(ga.
  \- archive_tool: umoci | buildah

build_constraints:
  # Configure the maximum image size. Either provide a number in bytes
  # or specify it with the suffix \(gam\(ga/\(gaM\(ga for megabytes or \(gag\(ga/\(gaG\(ga for
  # gigabytes.
  # If the resulting image exceeds the specified value, then KIWI will
  # abort with an error.
  # The default is no size constraint.
  \- max_size: 700m

runtime_checks:
  # Provide a list of runtime checks that should be disabled. Checks
  # that do not exist but are present in this list are silently
  # ignored.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.sp
This version of KIWI uses a different caller syntax compared to
former versions. However there is a compatibility mode which allows
to use a legacy KIWI commandline as follows:
