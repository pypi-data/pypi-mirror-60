"""
The :class:`text.annotation.Annotation` class is not quite a visualization, but it's an important class nevertheless.
This class is used to draw text on any visualization or matplotlib plot.
For example, it is used in the :class:`timeseries.timeseries.TimeSeries` visualization to draw text on visualizations and explain them better.
You can also use it on any normal matplotlib plot as long as you wrap it around a :class:`drawable.Drawable`:

.. code-block:: python

	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	from multiplex import drawable
	viz = drawable.Drawable(plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10)))
	annotation = Annotation(viz)
	lines = annotation.draw('Hello world!', (0, 2), 0)

The :class:`text.annotation.Annotation` class is most prominent in the :class:`text.text.TextAnnotation` class, described further down.
Text visualizations actually revolve around the basic annotation and use it to create text-only visualizations.
It also adds some extra functionality to annotations, such as legends.

Look over the :class:`text.annotation.Annotation` class to learn more about what kind of annotations you can create.
If you want to create text-only visualizations, skip ahead to the :class:`text.text.TextAnnotation` class.
