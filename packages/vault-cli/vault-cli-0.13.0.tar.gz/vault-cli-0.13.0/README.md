# CLI tool for Hashicorp Vault

This tools allows simple interactions with the vault API, allowing
configuration to be done in a separate step using a YAML configuration file.

This is especially interesting if you interact with Hashicorp Vault from
automated deployment tools.

## Installation

`pip install vault-cli`

Vault-cli only works with python 3.6 and over.

## Usage

```
Usage: vault [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Interact with a Vault. See subcommands for details.

  All arguments can be passed by environment variables:
  VAULT_CLI_UPPERCASE_NAME (including VAULT_CLI_PASSWORD and
  VAULT_CLI_TOKEN).

Options:
  -U, --url TEXT                  URL of the vault instance
  --verify / --no-verify          Verify HTTPS certificate
  --ca-bundle PATH                Location of the bundle containing the server
                                  certificate to check against.
  --login-cert PATH               Path to a public client certificate to use
                                  for connecting to vault.
  --login-cert-key PATH           Path to a private client certificate to use
                                  for connecting to vault.
  -T, --token-file PATH           File which contains the token to connect to
                                  Vault. Configuration file can also contain a

```

## Authentication

There are three ways to authenticate against the vault:
- Username and password file: provide a username and a file to read the
  password from. The file may be `-` for stdin.
- Client certificate: provide the path to a certificate file.
- Token: Bypass authentication step if you already have a valid token.

## Showcase

### Connect to https://vault.mydomain:8200/project and list the secrets
```console
$ vault --url=https://vault.mydomain:8200 --certificate=/etc/vault/certificate.key --base-path=project/ list
['my_secret']
```

On the following examples, we'll be considering that we have a complete configuration file.

### Read a secret in plain text (default)
```console
$ vault get my_secret
qwerty
```

### Read a secret in yaml format
```console
$ vault get --yaml my_secret
--- qwerty
...
```

### Write a secret
```console
$ vault set my_other_secret supersecret
Done
```

###Â Read/write a secret outside the base path
```console
$ export VAULT_CLI_BASE_PATH=myapp/
$ vault set /global_secret sharedsecret
Done
$ vault get /global_secret
sharedsecret
$ vault get global_secret
Error: Secret not found
$ unset VAULT_CLI_BASE_PATH
```


### Write a secret via stdin.
You can use this when the secret has multiple lines or starts with a "-"

```console
$ vault set third_secret --stdin
----BEGIN SECRET KEY----
...
<hit ctrl+d to end stdin>
Done

vault get third_secret
----BEGIN SECRET KEY----
...
```

Identically, piping allows you to write the content of a file into the vault:

```console
$ cat my_certificate.key | vault set third_secret --stdin
Done
```

### Write a secret using an invisible input prompt

This will avoid your secrets to be displayed in plain text in your shell history.

 ```console
 $ vault set mykey --prompt
 Please enter value for `mykey`:
 Done
 ```

### Anything following "--" will not be seen as a flag even if it starts with a "-"
```console
$ vault set -- -secret-name -oh-so-secret
Done

$ vault get -- -secret-name
-oh-so-secret
```

### Write a secret complex object
```console
$ vault set --yaml blob_secret "{code: supercode}"
Done
```

### Write a secret list
```console
$ vault set list_secret secret1 secret2 secret3
Done

# (For complex types, yaml format is selected)
$ vault get list_secret
---
- secret1
- secret2
- secret3
```

### Protect yourself from overwriting a secret by mistake

```console
vault set a b
Done
$ vault --safe-write set a c
Error: Secret already exists at a. Use -f to force overwriting.
$ vault --safe-write set -f a c
Done
```
(`safe-write` can be set in your configuration file, see details below)

### Get all values from the vault in a single command (yaml format)
```console
$ vault get-all
---
-secret-name: -oh-so-secret
blob_secret:
  code: supercode
list_secret:
- secret1
- secret2
- secret3
my_other_secret: supersecret
my_secret: qwerty
third_secret: '----BEGIN SECRET KEY----

  ...'
```

### Get a nested secret based on a path
```console
$ vault set test/my_folder_secret yaysecret
Done

$ vault get-all test/my_folder_secret
---
test:
  my_folder_secret: yaysecret
```

### Get all values recursively from several folders in a single command (yaml format)
```console
$ vault get-all test my_secret
---
my_secret: qwerty
test:
  my_folder_secret: yaysecret
```

### Delete a secret
```console
$ vault delete my_other_secret
Done
```

### Move secrets and folders
```console
$ vault mv my_secret test/my_secret
Move 'my_secret' to 'test/my_secret'

$ vault mv blob_secret test/blob_secret
Move 'blob_secret' to 'test/blob_secret'

$ vault get-all
---
-secret-name: -oh-so-secret
list_secret:
- secret1
- secret2
- secret3
test:
  blob_secret:
    code: supercode
  my_folder_secret: yaysecret
  my_secret: qwerty
third_secret: '----BEGIN SECRET KEY----

  ...'
```

### Launch a process loading secrets through environment variables
```console
$ vault env --path blob_secret -- env
...
BLOB_SECRET={"code": "supercode"}
...
$ vault set foo/bar/service/instance/dsn value
$ vault env --path blob_secret=blob --path foo/bar/service/instance=my -- env
...
BLOB={"code": "supercode"}
MY_DSN=value
...
```


### Render a template file with values from the vault
```console
$ vault template mytemplate.j2 > /etc/conf

# mytemplate.j2:
Hello={{ vault("my_secret") }}

# /etc/conf:
Hello=querty
```
(Use `-` for stdin and `-o <file or ->` to specify the file to write to, or stdout).

### (Re)create a configuration file based on the current settings
```console
$ vault --url https://something --token mytoken dump-config > .vault.yaml
```

### Delete everything under blob-secret
```console
$ vault delete-all blob-secret
```

### Delete everything, no confirmation
```console
$ vault delete-all --force
```

### Create a templated value
```console
$ vault set password foo
$ vault set dsn '!template!proto://username:{{ vault("password") }}@host/'
$ vault get dsn
proto://username:foo@host/
$ vault --no-render get --text dsn
!template!proto://username:{{ vault("password") }}@host/
```
The `vault` function does not render variables recursively.

### Get information on your current token
```
$ vault lookup-token
```

### Use the testing client in your tests

```console
$ pip install vault-cli[testing]
```

```python
# conftest.py (for pytest)
from vault_cli.testing import vault

__all__ = ["vault"]
```
```python
# test_something.py

def test_bla(vault):
    vault.db = {"a/b": "c"}

    assert vault.get_secret("a/b") == "c"

```

## Configuration

The first file found in the following location is read, parsed and used:
1. `/etc/vault.yml`
2. `~/.vault.yml`
3. `./vault.yml`

Any option passed as command line flag will be used over the corresponding
option in the documentation (use either `-` or `_`).

The expected format of the configuration is a mapping, with option names and
their corresponding values:

```yaml
---
username: my_username
password-file: ~/.vault-password
# or
token-file: ~/.vault-token
url: https://vault.mydomain:8200
verify: no
base-path: project/
...
```

Make sure the secret files have their permissions set accordingly.

For simple cases, you can directly define your `token` or `password` in the
file:

```yaml
---
username: my_username
password: secret-password
# or
token: secret-token
url: https://vault.mydomain:8200
verify: no
base-path: project/
...
```

If you do so, make sure the permissions of the configuration file itself are
not too broad.

Just note that the `--verify / --no-verify` flag become `verify: yes` or
`verify: no`

All parameters can be defined from environment variables:

```console
$ VAULT_CLI_URL=https://myvault.com vault list
```
The name is always the uppercase underscored name of the equivalent command
line option. Token and password can also be passed as environment variables as
VAULT_CLI_TOKEN and VAULT_CLI_PASSWORD.

## Troubleshooting

### `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`

You're most probably using Python 3.5 or below (including Python 2)

## State

The tool is currently in beta mode. It's missing docs and other things.
