Topoly requirements
=======================

Topoly is supported on the following Operating Systems:

* Mac OS X 10.9 or higher
* Linux 64 bit - for example Centos 6 or newer, Ubuntu 14.04 or newer

The Topoly PyPI packages contain both Python code as well as executable binaries and compiled shared libraries written in C and C++. Some algorithms, Alexander, in particular, have two implementations, one of which is faster but requires a CUDA compatible GPU and the CUDA framework version 7.5 or newer. The PyPI packages for Linux are built following the ManyLinux2010 specification that imposes the requirement of compatibility with Linux systems starting with CentOS 6, so most modern distributions are supported. Topoly packages for Mac OS are built on Mac OS 10.9 Mavericks so this is the oldest version of Mac OS X supported.

Both Linux and Mac OS X packages are available for Python 3, in particular for versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

Python 2.x is not supported!

The Topoly Python modules require the following dependent packages to be installed:
numpy, kiwisolver, six, cycler, pyparsing, python-dateutil, matplotlib,  argparse.
In case Topoly is installed using pip, these dependencies should be installed automatically.


Package structure
======================

All available versions of packages contain:

* Python modules that should be installed to the relevant Python 3 modules location
::

$USER/.local/lib/python3.x/site-packages

in case of an installation run by a specific user or::

/usr/local/lib/python3.x/site-packages

in case the installation is run by the administrator

* Executables and shared libraries that should be installed in
::

$USER/.local/bin
$USER/local/lib

or::

/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/lib

* Documentation and test examples available in
::

$USER/.local/share/doc/topoly

or::

/usr/local/share/doc/topoly

PyPI packages can also be installed in Python virtual environments such as venv or virtualenv. In that case Python modules,
executables and libraries will be found in folders relative to the main directory of the virtual environment.
