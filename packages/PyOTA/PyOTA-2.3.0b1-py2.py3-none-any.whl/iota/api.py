        This is either done deterministically (by generating all
        addresses until :py:meth:`find_transactions` returns an empty
        result), or by providing a key range to search.

            If ``None`` (default), then this method will not stop until
            it finds an unused address.

            .. note::
                An unused address is an address that **has not been spent from**
                and **has no transactions** referencing it on the Tangle.

                A snapshot removes transactions from the Tangle. As a
                consequence, after a snapshot, it may happen that this API does
                not return the correct inputs with ``stop`` being ``None``.

                As a workaround, you can save your used addresses and their
                ``key_index`` attribute in a local database. Use the
                ``start`` and ``stop`` parameters to tell the API from where to

            If set, determines the minimum threshold for a successful
            result:

            - As soon as this threshold is reached, iteration will stop.
            - If the command runs out of addresses before the threshold
              is reached, an exception is raised.

            .. note::
                This method does not attempt to "optimize" the result
                (e.g., smallest number of inputs, get as close to
                ``threshold`` as possible, etc.); it simply accumulates
                inputs in order until the threshold is met.

            If ``threshold`` is 0, the first address in the key range
            with a non-zero balance will be returned (if it exists).

            If ``threshold`` is ``None`` (default), this method will
            return **all** inputs in the specified key range.

            Number of iterations to use when generating new addresses
            (see :py:meth:`get_new_addresses`).

            This value must be between 1 and 3, inclusive.
