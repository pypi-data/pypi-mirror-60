<p>A pendulum executes simple harmonic motion. If the anglular displacement
is plotted against time, we get a sine wave. But angle encoders are costly,
we can use a DC motor as angular velocity encoder, the induced voltage is
proportional to the instantaneous angular velocity.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>The pendulum is attached to the axis of the motor.</li>
<li>The induced DC voltage is proportional to the angular velocity.</li>
<li>The signal is measured by A3. The 100 Ohm resistor between Rg and Ground, 
sets an amplificaion factor of 1 + 10000/100 = 101, it is required since the 
induced voltage is small.</li>
<li>Oscillate the pendulum and press <strong>START</strong> button to record the data.</li>
<li>If the signal is noisy, try rotating the whole body of the motor by several
degrees and try again.</li>
