<p>This program plots A1 vs A2 or (A1-A2) vs A2. It is useful for plotting Lissajous figures
and stdying RC circuits</p>

<p>For the circuit shown above, we can plot the voltage across the capacitor against the 
voltage across the resistor. It will form a circle when they are equal.

<li>Select C = 1uF, R = 1 kOhm and plot (A1-A2) vs A2. Adjust the frequency to get a circle</li>
</ul>
