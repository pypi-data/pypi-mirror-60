<ul>
<li>The two coils provided with ExpEYES are used as the primay andsecondary.</li>
<li>WG output is applied to the primary and voltage is monitored on A1.</li>
<li>Induced voltage on secondary is monitored on A2.</li>
<li>Make connections and kKeep the coils close and parallel.</li>
<li>Insert some ferromagnetic marerial through the coils to increase the
voltage induced on the secondary coil.</li>
</ul>
