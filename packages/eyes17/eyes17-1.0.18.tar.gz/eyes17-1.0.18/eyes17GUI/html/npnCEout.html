<ul>
<li>The output characteristic curve of an NPN transistor at different
base currents are plotted.</li>
<li>The base current is set by the voltage at PV2.</li>
<li>Voltage at PV1 is applied to the collector, via a 1k resistor.</li>
<li>The value of PV1 is incremented in steps and at each step the collector
voltage is measured.</li>
<li>The Collector current is calculated from the voltage drop across the 1k resistor.</li>
<li>Make connections, use any NPN transistor, 2N2222 is provided with the kit.</li>
<li>Press <strong>START</strong> to get a Vc-Ic plot for a particular Ib. Change Ib by changing PV2 volatge.</li>
</ul>
