<ul>
<li>The objective is to apply an AC voltage to a series RC, RL or RLC circuit
to study the amplitude and phase across the circuit elements as a function of frequency. </li>

<li>The reactance values of Capacitors and Inductors change with frequency.</li>
<li>In the case of RLC circuit, resonance occurs When XL = Xc, and voltage across LC becomes early zero(not exactly zero because of the resistance of the Inductor</li>
<li> Connect A3 to the junction of L and C to monitor the voltages across them.
To observe series resonance, Choose C = 1uF and L = 10 mH. The frequency to around 1600 Hz, adjust frequency to make the phase difference
across LC almost to zero.</li>
</ul>
