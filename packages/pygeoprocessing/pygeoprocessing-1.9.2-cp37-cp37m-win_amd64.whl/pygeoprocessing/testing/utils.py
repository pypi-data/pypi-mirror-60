def digest_file_list(filepath_list, ifdir='skip'):
    """
    Create a single MD5sum from all the files in `filepath_list`.

    This is done by creating an MD5sum from the string MD5sums calculated
    from each individual file in the list. The filepath_list will be sorted
    before generating an MD5sum. If a given file is in this list multiple
    times, it will be double-counted.

    Note:
        When passed a list with a single file in it, this function will produce
        a different MD5sum than if you were to simply take the md5sum of that
        single file.  This is because this function produces an MD5sum of
        MD5sums.

    Parameters:
        filepath_list (list of strings): A list of files to analyze.
        ifdir (string): Either 'skip' or 'raise'.  Indicates what to do
            if a directory is encountered in this list.  If 'skip', the
            directory skipped will be logged.  If 'raise', IOError will
            be raised with the directory name.

    Returns:
        A string MD5sum generated for all of the files in the list.

    Raises:
        IOError: When a file in `filepath_list` is a directory and
            `ifdir == skip` or a file could not be found.
