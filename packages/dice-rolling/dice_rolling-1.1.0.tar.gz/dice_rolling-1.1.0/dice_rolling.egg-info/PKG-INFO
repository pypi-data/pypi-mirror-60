Description: # Dice rolling
        
        This module aims to implement the throw of many types of dice.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Simply run:
        
        ```bash
        pip install dice-rolling
        ```
        
        ## CLI usage
        
        Once installed, a throw of a simple die of 6 sides can be performed with:
        
        ```bash
        $ roll 1d6
        Rolled 1d6 and got 4. [4]
        ```
        
        Or, for instance, to throw three 20-sided dice can be as simple as:
        
        ```bash
        $ roll 3d20
        Rolled 3d20 and got 36. [14, 9, 13]
        ```
        
        ## Module usage
        
        To use this module you should use the class RollBuilder to implement the throws:
        
        ```python
        from dice_rolling import RollBuilder
        
        builder = RollBuilder()
        builder.set_amount_of_dice(3)
        builder.set_number_of_sides(20)
        builder.build()
        
        print(builder.get_result())
        ```
        
        
        ## Throws
        
        The request must start with `x`d`y`, where `x` is the number of dice and `y` the number of faces of each die.
        
        For example, to roll 4 6-sided dice:
        ```bash
        $ roll 4d6
        Rolled 4d6 and got 16. [5, 2, 3, 6]
        ```
        
        After that, the following modifiers have been implemented
        (using the previous result as reference):
        
        - `+a`: Add the value of `a` to each die.
          For example, to roll 4 6-sided dice and add 3 to each roll:
          ```bash
          $ roll 4d6+3
          Rolled 4d6+3 and got 28. [8, 5, 6, 9]
          ```
        
        - `khb`: `K`eep the `H`ighest `b`.
          For example, to roll 4 6-sided dice and keep the highest 2:
          ```bash
          $ roll 4d6kh2
          Rolled 4d6kh2 and got 11. Kept [5, 6] and discarded [3, 2].
          ```
        - `klc`: `K`eep the `L`owest `c`.
          For example, to roll 4 6-sided dice and keep the lowest 2:
          ```bash
          $ roll 4d6kl2
          Rolled 4d6kl2 and got 5. Kept [2, 3] and discarded [5, 6].
          ```
        
        Of course you can use together an addition with any of the *keep* actions:
        ```bash
        $ roll 4d6+5kh2
        Rolled 4d6+5kh2 and got 21. Kept [11, 10] and discarded [8, 7].
        ```
