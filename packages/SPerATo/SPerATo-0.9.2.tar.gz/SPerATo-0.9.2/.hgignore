# I want to avoid the inclusion of the old stuff
# in dist:
dist/*

# also precompiled files:
*.pyc

# the build directory should be skipped too:
build/**

# as well as the doc/_build dir:
doc/_build/**

# and package related stuff:
SPerATo.egg-info/**

# And of course, caches generated by the testing tools:
.cache/**

MANIFEST
.coverage
.eggs/**
.tox/**
.pytest_cache/**
