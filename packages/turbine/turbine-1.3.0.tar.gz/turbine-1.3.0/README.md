# Turbine
A Python 3 tool to harness the google cloud to run shell scripts. In particular, if you have
1. a docker image and
2. many independent, idempotent tasks for that image written as shell scripts,

Turbine allows you to run those tasks on many VMs in parallel on GCE. See [this jupyter notebook](example/example_usage.ipynb) for detailed usage.

Turbine is a lot like
* [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/) except you don't need to hit an HTTP endpoint and it supports large machine types and accelerators;
* [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) except it supports large machine types and accelerators; and
* [Batch on GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/batch/running-job) except I understand it, it is significantly lighter-weight than Kubernetes, and it provides a path for TPU access.

# Installation
Turbine consists of two components:
1. A controller on the local machine to setup cloud components, enter tasks, and provision VMs.
2. A small shim to run inside of the docker image and retrieve tasks.

For most users, the recommended method to install the controller is via pip:

```
pip install turbine
```

To attach turbine to a docker image, simply install turbine on the image via pip:
```
RUN pip install turbine
```

Note that the `ENTRYPOINT` of the docker image will be overwritten when used by the Turbine controller.

## Dependencies:
* google-cloud-pubsub
* google-cloud-storage
