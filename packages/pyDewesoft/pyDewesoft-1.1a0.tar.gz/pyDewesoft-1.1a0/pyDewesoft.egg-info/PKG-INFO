Description: # pyDewesoft module
        
        Python module to work with Dewesoft files. 
        
        Current capabilities:
        * Reading native Dewesoft files (.d7d, .dxd, .d7z and .dxz)
        * Appending multiple Dewesoft files in a single Python data object.
        * Filling time gaps between multiple Dewesoft files, to create a continues time vector (useful when Dewesoft has error due to data lost)
        * Data is stored in a Python object, where each channel is an attribute
        * Time vectors are stored effectively for each channel. If a time vector is used for multiple channels it is only stored once.
        * Saving to disk of the Python object is done with the highest compression rate
