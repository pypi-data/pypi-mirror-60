This module contains functions to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on a fault,
after a timeout, or on a user signal. Call :func:`faulthandler.enable` to
install fault handlers for the :const:`SIGSEGV`, :const:`SIGFPE`,
:const:`SIGABRT`, :const:`SIGBUS`, and :const:`SIGILL` signals. You can also
enable them at startup by setting the :envvar:`PYTHONFAULTHANDLER` environment
variable.

The fault handler is compatible with system fault handlers like Apport or the
Windows fault handler. The module uses an alternative stack for signal handlers
if the :c:func:`sigaltstack` function is available. This allows it to dump the
traceback even on a stack overflow.

The fault handler is called on catastrophic cases and therefore can only use
signal-safe functions (e.g. it cannot allocate memory on the heap). Because of
this limitation traceback dumping is minimal compared to normal Python
tracebacks:

* Only ASCII is supported. The ``backslashreplace`` error handler is used on
  encoding.
* Each string is limited to 500 characters.
* Only the filename, the function name and the line number are
  displayed. (no source code)
* It is limited to 100 frames and 100 threads.
* The order is reversed: the most recent call is shown first.

By default, the Python traceback is written to :data:`sys.stderr`. To see
tracebacks, applications must be run in the terminal. A log file can
alternatively be passed to :func:`faulthandler.enable`.

The module is implemented in C, so tracebacks can be dumped on a crash or when
Python is deadlocked.

This module is the backport for CPython 2.7. It is part of Python standard
library since CPython 3.3: `faulthandler module
<http://docs.python.org/dev/library/faulthandler.html>`_. For PyPy,
faulthandler is builtin since PyPy 5.5: use ``pypy -X faulthandler``.

faulthandler works on CPython 2.7. It might work on Python 2.5-3.5, but
these versions are no longer supported officially.

faulthandler 3.2 is the last version released by Victor Stinner. I maintained
it for 10 years in my free time for the great pleasure of Python 2 users, but
Python 2 is no longer supported upstream since 2020-01-01. Each faulthandler
release requires me to start my Windows VM, install Python 2.7 in 32-bit and
64-bit, install an old C compiler just for Python 2.7, and type manually some
commands to upload Windows binaries. Moreover, I have to fix some issues on
Travis CI and many small boring tasks. The maintenance is far from being free.
In 10 years, I got zero "thank you" (and 0â‚¬), only bug reports :-)


Example
=======

.. highlight:: sh

Example of a segmentation fault on Linux: ::

    $ python
    >>> import faulthandler
    >>> faulthandler.enable()
    >>> import ctypes
    >>> ctypes.string_at(0)
    Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault

    Current thread 0x00007fea4a98c700 (most recent call first):
      File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/ctypes/__init__.py", line 504 in string_at
      File "<stdin>", line 1 in <module>
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)


Nosetests and py.test
=====================

To use faulthandler in `nose tests <https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
you can use the `nose-faulthandler <https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
plugin.

To use it in `py.test <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_, you can use the
`pytest-faulthandler <https://github.com/nicoddemus/pytest-faulthandler>`_
plugin.


Installation
============

faulthandler supports Python 2.7. It may also support Python 2.5, 2.6,
3.1 and 3.2, but these versions are no more officially supported.

Install faulthandler on Windows using pip
-----------------------------------------

Procedure to install faulthandler on Windows:

* `Install pip
  <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_: download
  ``get-pip.py`` and type::

  \Python27\python.exe get-pip.py

* If you already have pip, ensure that you have at least pip 1.4 (to support
  wheel packages). If you need to upgrade::

  \Python27\python.exe -m pip install -U pip

* Install faulthandler::

  \Python27\python.exe -m pip install faulthandler

pythonxy (Windows)
------------------

faulthandler is part of `pythonxy distribution
<http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_: free scientific and engineering
development software for Windows.


Install from source code
------------------------

Download the latest tarball from the `Python Cheeseshop (PyPI)
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/faulthandler/>`_.

To install faulthandler module, type the following command: ::

    python setup.py install

Then you can test your setup using the following command: ::

    python tests.py

You need a C compiler (eg. gcc) and Python headers to build the faulthandler
module. Eg. on Fedora, you have to install python-devel package (sudo yum
install python-devel).


faulthandler module API
=======================

``faulthandler.version`` is the module version as a tuple: ``(major, minor)``.
``faulthandler.__version__`` is the module version as a string (e.g.
``"2.0"``).

Dumping the traceback
---------------------

.. function:: dump_traceback(file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True)

   Dump the tracebacks of all threads into *file*. If *all_threads* is
   ``False``, dump only the current thread.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.


Fault handler state
-------------------

.. function:: enable(file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True)

   Enable the fault handler: install handlers for the :const:`SIGSEGV`,
   :const:`SIGFPE`, :const:`SIGABRT`, :const:`SIGBUS` and :const:`SIGILL`
   signals to dump the Python traceback. If *all_threads* is ``True``,
   produce tracebacks for every running thread. Otherwise, dump only the current
   thread.

   The *file* must be kept open until the fault handler is disabled: see
   :ref:`issue with file descriptors <faulthandler-fd>`.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.

.. function:: disable()

   Disable the fault handler: uninstall the signal handlers installed by
   :func:`enable`.

.. function:: is_enabled()

   Check if the fault handler is enabled.


Dumping the tracebacks after a timeout
--------------------------------------

.. function:: dump_traceback_later(timeout, repeat=False, file=sys.stderr, exit=False)

   Dump the tracebacks of all threads, after a timeout of *timeout* seconds, or
   every *timeout* seconds if *repeat* is ``True``.  If *exit* is ``True``, call
   :c:func:`_exit` with status=1 after dumping the tracebacks.  (Note
   :c:func:`_exit` exits the process immediately, which means it doesn't do any
   cleanup like flushing file buffers.) If the function is called twice, the new
   call replaces previous parameters and resets the timeout. The timer has a
   sub-second resolution.

   The *file* must be kept open until the traceback is dumped or
   :func:`cancel_dump_traceback_later` is called: see :ref:`issue with file
   descriptors <faulthandler-fd>`.

   This function is implemented using the ``SIGALRM`` signal and the
   ``alarm()`` function. If the signal handler is called during a system call,
   the system call is interrupted and fails with ``EINTR``.

   Not available on Windows.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.

.. function:: cancel_dump_traceback_later()

   Cancel the last call to :func:`dump_traceback_later`.


Dumping the traceback on a user signal
--------------------------------------

.. function:: register(signum, file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True, chain=False)

   Register a user signal: install a handler for the *signum* signal to dump
   the traceback of all threads, or of the current thread if *all_threads* is
   ``False``, into *file*. Call the previous handler if chain is ``True``.

   The *file* must be kept open until the signal is unregistered by
   :func:`unregister`: see :ref:`issue with file descriptors <faulthandler-fd>`.

   Not available on Windows.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.

.. function:: unregister(signum)

   Unregister a user signal: uninstall the handler of the *signum* signal
   installed by :func:`register`. Return ``True`` if the signal was registered,
   ``False`` otherwise.

   Not available on Windows.


.. _faulthandler-fd:

Issue with file descriptors
---------------------------

:func:`enable`, :func:`dump_traceback_later` and :func:`register` keep the
file descriptor of their *file* argument. If the file is closed and its file
descriptor is reused by a new file, or if :func:`os.dup2` is used to replace
the file descriptor, the traceback will be written into a different file. Call
these functions again each time that the file is replaced.


Differences with stdlib faulthandler
====================================

faulthandler is now part of CPython standard library since version 3.3.
CPython 3.3 and newer got enhancements which are not available on CPython 2.7
and so this faulthandler backport for CPython 2.7 has limitations:

faulthandler signal handler
---------------------------

The faulthandler signal handler and the ``dump_traceback()`` function call
``PyGILState_GetThisThreadState()`` to get the Python thread state of the
current thread even if it doesn't hold the GIL. This function uses a *Thread
Local Storage* (TLS) variable. Since CPython 3.2, TLS use native functions:

* UNIX/BSD: ``pthread_getspecific()``, ``pthread_setspecific()``
* Windows: ``TlsGetValue()``, ``TlsSetValue()``

But CPython 2.7 uses its own implementation of TLS using a single-linked list
and a lock. Locks are not signal-safe: using a lock in a signal handler may
work or may block forever.


dump_traceback_later()
----------------------

dump_traceback_later() is implemented with ``alarm(seconds)`` on CPython 2.7
and so the timer has a resolution of 1 second, whereas CPython 3 uses a
"watchdog" thread and a lock with a timeout
(``PyThread_acquire_lock_timed()``) with a resolution of 1 microseconds.

``alarm()`` requires to set a signal handler for ``SIGALRM`` whereas the
application may want to use this signal for a different purpose. Raising the
``SIGALRM`` signal has side effects like interrupting the current syscall which
would fail with ``EINTR`` error whereas Python 2.7 has a bad support of
``EINTR`` errors. CPython 3.5 now automatically retries syscalls failing with
``EINTR``: see `PEP 475 -- Retry system calls failing with EINTR
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0475/>`_.

.. note:

   The CPython 3 watchdog thread ignores all signals using::

    sigset_t set;
    sigfillset(&set);
    pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &set, NULL);


Changelog
=========

Version 3.2 (2020-01-27)
------------------------

faulthandler 3.2 is the last version released by Victor Stinner. I maintained
it for 10 years in my free time for the great pleasure of Python 2 users, but
Python 2 is no longer supported upstream since 2020-01-01. Each faulthandler
release requires me to start my Windows VM, install Python 2.7 in 32-bit and
64-bit, install an old C compiler just for Python 2.7, and type manually some
commands to upload Windows binaries. Moreover, I have to fix some issues on
Travis CI and many small boring tasks. The maintenance is far from being free.
In 10 years, I got zero "thank you" (and 0â‚¬), only bug reports :-)

* On Windows, faulthandler.enable() now ignores MSC and COM exceptions.
  Backport by Dee Moore.
* Fix ``faulthandler.register(chain=True)`` stack. faulthandler now allocates a
  dedicated stack of ``SIGSTKSZ*2`` bytes, instead of just ``SIGSTKSZ`` bytes.
  Calling the previous signal handler in faulthandler signal handler uses more
  than ``SIGSTKSZ`` bytes of stack memory on some platforms.
* Python 2.6 is no longer tested by Travis CI.

Version 3.1 (2018-04-23)
------------------------

* Project moved from https://github.com/haypo/faulthandler to
  https://github.com/vstinner/faulthandler
* Fix tests: accept "python2" and "python2.7" thread name in tests
* Fix tests on Python 2.6.

Version 3.0 (2017-09-16)
------------------------

* On Windows, faulthandler.register() now also installs an handler for Windows
  exceptions.

Version 2.6 (2017-03-22)
------------------------

* Add support for the ``PYTHONFAULTHANDLER`` environment variable. Patch
  written by Ionel Cristian MÄƒrieÈ™.

Version 2.5 (2017-03-22)
------------------------

* Issue #23433: Fix undefined behaviour in ``faulthandler._stack_overflow()``:
  don't compare pointers, use the ``Py_uintptr_t`` type instead of ``void*``.
  It fixes ``test_faulthandler`` on Fedora 22 which now uses GCC 5.
* The ``write()`` function used to write the traceback is now retried when it
  is interrupted by a signal.
- Issue #23566: enable(), register(), dump_traceback() and
  dump_traceback_later() functions now accept file descriptors. Patch by Wei
  Wu.
* Drop support and Python 2.5, 2.6, 3.1 and 3.2: only support Python 2.7.
  No Linux distribution use these versions anymore, so it becomes difficult
  to test these versions.
* Add tox.ini to run tests with tox: it creates a virtual environment, compile
  and install faulthandler, and run unit tests.
* Add Travis YAML configuration.

Version 2.4 (2014-10-02)
------------------------

* Add a new documentation written with Sphinx used to built a new website:
  https://faulthandler.readthedocs.io/
* Python issue #19306: Add extra hints to faulthandler stack dumps that they
  are upside down.
* Python issue #15463: the faulthandler module truncates strings to 500
  characters, instead of 100, to be able to display long file paths.
* faulthandler issue #7: Ignore Windows SDK message "This application has
  requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. (...)" in
  test_fatal_error(). It was not a bug in faulthandler, just an issue with
  the unit test on some Windows setup.
* Python issue #21497: faulthandler functions now raise a better error if
  ``sys.stderr`` is ``None``: RuntimeError("sys.stderr is None") instead of
  AttributeError("'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fileno'").
* Suppress crash reporter in tests. For example, avoid popup on Windows and
  don't generate a core dump on Linux.


Version 2.3 (2013-12-17)
------------------------

* faulthandler.register() now keeps the previous signal handler when the
  function is called twice, so faulthandler.unregister() restores correctly
  the original signal handler.

Version 2.2 (2013-03-19)
------------------------

* Rename dump_tracebacks_later() to dump_traceback_later():
  use the same API than the faulthandler module of Python 3.3
* Fix handling of errno variable in the handler of user signals
* Fix the handler of user signals: chain the previous signal
  handler even if getting the current thread state failed

Version 2.1 (2012-02-05)
------------------------

Major changes:

* Add an optional chain argument to faulthandler.register()

Minor changes:

* Fix faulthandler._sigsegv() for Clang 3.0
* Fix compilation on Visual Studio

Version 2.0 (2011-05-10)
------------------------

Major changes:

* faulthandler is now part of Python 3.3
* enable() handles also the SIGABRT signal
* Add exit option to dump_traceback_later(): if True, exit the program
  on timeout after dumping the traceback

Other changes:

* Change default value of the all_threads argument: dump all threads by
  default because under some rare conditions, it is not possible to get
  the current thread
* Save/restore errno in signal handlers
* dump_traceback_later() always dump all threads: remove all_threads option
* Add faulthandler.__version__ attribute (module version as a string)
* faulthandler.version is now a tuple
* Rename:

  * dump_traceback_later() to dump_traceback_later()
  * cancel_dump_traceback_later() to cancel_dump_traceback_later()
  * sigsegv() to _sigsegv()
  * sigfpe() to _sigfpe()
  * sigbus() to _sigbus()
  * sigill() to _sigill()

* register() and unregister() are no more available on Windows. They were
  useless: only SIGSEGV, SIGABRT and SIGILL can be handled by the application,
  and these signals can only be handled by enable().
* Add _fatal_error(), _read_null(), _sigabrt() and _stack_overflow() test
  functions
* register() uses sigaction() SA_RESTART flag to try to not interrupt the
  current system call
* The fault handler calls the previous signal handler, using sigaction()
  SA_NODEFER flag to call it immediately
* enable() raises an OSError if it was not possible to register a signal
  handler
* Set module size to 0, instead of -1, to be able to unload the module with
  Python 3
* Fix a reference leak in dump_traceback_later()
* Fix register() if it called twice with the same signal
* Implement m_traverse for Python 3 to help the garbage collector
* Move code from faulthandler/\*.c to faulthandler.c and traceback.c: the code
  is simpler and it was easier to integrate faulthandler into Python 3.3 using
  one file (traceback.c already existed in Python)
* register() uses a static list for all signals instead of reallocating memory
  each time a new signal is registered, because the list is shared with the
  signal handler which may be called anytime.

Version 1.5 (2011-03-24)
------------------------

* Conform to the PEP 8:

  * Rename isenabled() to is_enabled()
  * Rename dumpbacktrace() to dump_traceback()
  * Rename dumpbacktrace_later() to dump_traceback_later()
  * Rename cancel_dumpbacktrace_later() to cancel_dump_traceback_later()

* Limit strings to 100 characters
* dump_traceback_later() signal handler doesn't clear its reference to the
  file, because Py_CLEAR() is not signal safe: you have to call explicitly
  cancel_dump_traceback_later()

Version 1.4 (2011-02-14)
------------------------

* Add register() and unregister() functions
* Add optional all_threads argument to enable()
* Limit the backtrace to 100 threads
* Allocate an alternative stack for the fatal signal handler to be able to
  display a backtrace on a stack overflow (define HAVE_SIGALTSTACK). Not
  available on Windows.

Version 1.3 (2011-01-31)
------------------------

* Don't compile dumpbacktrace_later() and cancel_dumpbacktrace_later() on
  Windows because alarm() is missing

Version 1.2 (2011-01-31)
------------------------

* Add dumpbacktrace_later() and cancel_dumpbacktrace_later() function
* enable() and dumpbacktrace() get an optional file argument
* Replace dumpbacktrace_threads() function by a new dumpbacktrace() argument:
  dumpbacktrace(all_threads=True)
* enable() gets the file descriptor of sys.stderr instead of using the file
  descriptor 2

Version 1.1 (2011-01-03)
------------------------

* Disable the handler by default, because pkgutil may load the module and so
  enable the handler which is unexpected
* Add dumpbacktrace() and dumpbacktrace_threads() functions
* sigill() is available on Windows thanks to Martin's patch
* Fix dump_ascii() for signed char type (eg. on FreeBSD)
* Fix tests.py for Python 2.5

Version 1.0 (2010-12-24)
------------------------

  First public release
