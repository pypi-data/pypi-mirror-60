Description: # csui-git-wrapper
        
        Wraps Git commands for submission. Similiar to `submit50` (https://github.com/cs50/submit50.git), but this is much simpler and cross-platform.
        Intended for specific Fasilkom UI usage.
        This package is intended to use with Python 3.6 or newer.
        
        ## Installation
        To install this package, run:
        ```bash
        python -m pip install csui-git-wrapper
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        To submit your works:
        ```bash
        csuisubmit submit
        ```
        When you are submitting for the first time, you will be asked for your full name, your student number (NPM), your UI or GitLab CSUI account, your course's short name (without any spaces or punctuations), and your working directory (where you put your tutorials/assignments).
        After that, in every submission, you will be required to put a message. The message usually defined by your lecturer on the assignment problem set.
        
        ## Need to reconfigure?
        You can reconfigure your `csuisubmit` by using this command:
        ```bash
        csuisubmit configure
        ```
        Then, you will be asked for things just like the first time you are using `csui-git-wrapper`.
