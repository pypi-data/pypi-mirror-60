===========================================
Jug: A Task-Based Parallelization Framework
===========================================

Jug allows you to write code that is broken up into
tasks and run different tasks on different processors.

It uses the filesystem to communicate between processes and
works correctly over NFS, so you can coordinate processes on
different machines.

Jug is a pure Python implementation and should work on any platform.

Python 2.6/2.7 and Python 3.5+ are supported.

Install
-------

You can install Jug with pip::

    pip install Jug

or use, if you are using `conda <http://anaconda.org/>`__, you can install jug
from `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.github.io/>`__ using the following
commands::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install jug

Short Example
-------------

Here is a one minute example. Save the following to a file called ``primes.py``
(if you have installed jug, you can obtain a slightly longer version of this
example by running ``jug demo`` on the command line)::

    from jug import TaskGenerator
    from time import sleep

    @TaskGenerator
    def is_prime(n):
        sleep(1.)
        for j in range(2,n-1):
            if (n % j) == 0:
                return False
        return True

    primes100 = [is_prime(n) for n in range(2,101)]

This is a brute-force way to find all the prime numbers up to 100. Of course,
this is only for didactical purposes, normally you would use a better method.
Similarly, the ``sleep`` function is so that it does not run too fast. Still,
it illustrates the basic functionality of Jug for embarassingly parallel
problems.

Type ``jug status primes.py`` to get::

    Task name                  Waiting       Ready    Finished     Running
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    primes.is_prime                  0          99           0           0
    ......................................................................
    Total:                           0          99           0           0


This tells you that you have 99 tasks called ``primes.is_prime`` ready to run.
So run ``jug execute primes.py &``. You can even run multiple instances in the
background (if you have multiple cores, for example). After starting 4
instances and waiting a few seconds, you can check the status again (with ``jug
status primes.py``)::

    Task name                  Waiting       Ready    Finished     Running
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    primes.is_prime                  0          63          32           4
    ......................................................................
    Total:                           0          63          32           4


Now you have 32 tasks finished, 4 running, and 63 still ready. Eventually, they
will all finish and you can inspect the results with ``jug shell primes.py``.
This will give you an ``ipython`` shell. The `primes100` variable is available,
but it is an ugly list of `jug.Task` objects. To get the actual value, you call
the `value` function::

    In [1]: primes100 = value(primes100)

    In [2]: primes100[:10]
    Out[2]: [True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True]
