Description: # mukham
        
        Mukham (ముఖం; mook-hum) means face in Telugu! mukham is a simple library to detect the largest face in a given image.
        The face detection is performed using the DNN algorithm provided by `opencv-python`. The largest face is the box with largest enclosing area from the bounds of candidate faces detected. 
        
        ### Requirements
        This package was written and tested in python 3.7+. This package requires the following dependencies:
        ```
            numpy>=1.18.1
            opencv-python>=4.1.2.30
        ```
        
        ### Installation
        The package can be installed as follows:
        ```
            pip install mukham
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        The package can be used through one of the following ways. 
        
        #### Command-line interface
        ```
            python -m mukham -i/--input path/to/input_image -o/--ouput path/to/output_largest_face -c/--conf confidence_threshold
        ```
        
        the `input` argument is required. The `-c/--conf`  is optional, otherwise must be a floating point number between 0 and 1 with default value of `0.8`.
        
        #### Code
        ```
            from mukham.detector import detect_largest_face
        
            bounding_box = detect_largest_face(path_to_input_img, out_path=path_to_output_img, min_conf=confidence_threshold)
        ```
        
        The `out_path` is an optional keyword argument default to `None`. `min_conf` is also a keyword argument with default set to `0.8`. `detect_largest_face` will return a 2x2 array of the top left and bottom right corner of the bounding box for the largest face.
