The later publication provides a nice overview of the features introduced in version
0.11 and further developed in v0.12, v0.13 & v0.14 and should be the one cited in
publications using pyFAI (or one of the graphical application on top of it).
There are already 93 publication referring to pyFAI, some of them in the most
prestigious scientific journals (Nature, PNAS, ...).
