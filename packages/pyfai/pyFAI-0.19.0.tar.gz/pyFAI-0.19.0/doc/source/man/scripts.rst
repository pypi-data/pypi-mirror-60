pyFAI scripts manual
====================

While pyFAI is first and foremost a Python library to be used by developers, a set of scripts is provided to process
a full diffraction experiment on the command line without knowing anything about Python.
Those scripts can be divided into 3 categories: pre-processing tools which prepare the dataset for the calibration tool.
The calibration is the determination of the geometry of the experimental setup using Debye-Scherrer rings of a reference compound (or calibrant).
Finally a full dataset can be integrated using different tools targeted at different experiments.

Pre-processing tools:
 * ``pyFAI-drawmask``: tool for drawing a mask on top of an image (deprecated)
 * ``pyFAI-average``: tool for averaging/median/... filtering images (i.e. for dark current)

Calibration tools:
 * ``pyFAI-calib2`` and ``pyFAI-calib``: manually select the rings and refine the geometry
 * ``pyFAI-recalib``: automatic ring extraction to refine the geometry (deprecated: see "recalib" option in pyFAI-calib)
 * ``MX-calibrate``: Calibrate automatically a set of images taken at various detector distances
 * ``check_calib``: checks the calibration of an image at the sub-pixel level (deprecated: see "validate" option in pyFAI-calib)

Azimuthal integration tools:
 * ``pyFAI-integrate``: the graphical interface for integration (GUI)
 * ``pyFAI-saxs``: command line interface for small-angle scattering
 * ``pyFAI-waxs``: command line interface for powder difration
 * ``diff_map``: diffraction mapping & tomography tool (command line and GUI)
 * ``diff_tomo``: diffraction tomography tool (command line only)
