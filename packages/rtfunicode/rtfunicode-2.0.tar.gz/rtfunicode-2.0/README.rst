Unicode to RTF command code conversion
======================================

This module implements an encoder for unicode to RTF 1.5 command sequences; it
can be used to generate valid RTF output with international characters.

Importing this module adds a new `rtfunicode` codec, allowing you to encode
unicode strings to valid RTF bytecode sequences:

>>> import rtfunicode
>>> u'RTF and unicode mix just fine! \u263A'.encode('rtfunicode')
'RTF and unicode mix just fine! \\u9786?'

The RTF command code for a unicode character is `\uN?`, where N is a signed
16-bit integer and the ? is a placeholder character for older RTF readers. This
module sets the latter to the '?' literal for simlicity's sake.
