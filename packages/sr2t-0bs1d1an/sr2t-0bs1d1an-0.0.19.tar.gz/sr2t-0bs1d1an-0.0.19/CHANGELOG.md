### Added

- Ho ho ho, added arguments to specify your own custom Nessus YAML files for auto classifications, and the Nessus TLS, X.509, and HTTP worksheets.
Have a look at the YAML files in the 'sr2t/data' folder to see how you can create your own custom YAML files.

No need to specify '--nmap-protocol' anymore.
