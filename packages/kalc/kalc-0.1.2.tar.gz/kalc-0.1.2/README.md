# Overview

`kalc` is a Kubernetes operations automation system built on pure [AI planning](https://github.com/criticalhop/poodle).

Currently, `kalc` provides a single command, `kalc-optimize` to do automatic cluster rebalancing and optimization.

`kalc` can also be used with [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) in interactive mode.

# Quick Start

## Requirements

- Linux x86_64
- Python 3.7+
- 6+ GB RAM, decent CPU
- Up to 20GB of disk space in `/tmp` for generated models
- `kubectl` installed and connected to cluster

## Installation

    pip install kalc

## Basic usage

    $ kalc-optimize

`kalc-optimize` will generate `bash` scripts containing `kubectl` commands to get to more optimal states. Have a look at those scripts and execute any one of them, then stop and re-run `kalc-optimize`.

## Autopilot

`kalc` can optimize your cluster in background, gradually increasing reliability and cost.

# Architecture

- `kalc-optimize` will download current cluster state by executing `kubectl get all` and will start generating `bash` scripts into current folder
- Each generated `bash` script contains a sequence of `kubectl` commands to get the cluster in a more optimal state: better balanced nodes for availability and OOM/eviction resilience and a more compact packing
- As `kalc` continues to compute, it will emit more optimal states and bigger bash scripts with kubectl commands

`kalc` aims to take into account current policies, anti-affility, SLO levels and best practices from successful production Kubernetes clusters.

# Project Status

`kalc` is a developer preview and currently supports a subset of Kubernetes resources and behaviour model.
