Notes to the maintainer on what to do during a release
======================================================

* Bump versions in setup.py, aiocoap/meta.py and doc/conf.py
* git tag
* git clean, or `git stash -u` (to avoid including uncommitted
  files)
* ./setup.py sdist upload
* push everything including tags
* log in to readthedocs, add new tag as new version
* Bump versions to add a ".post0"
  * This serves to indicate that anything built from git is not identical to
    the last release.
