    WARNING: Instantiating Session without specifying a backend is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. For current behaviour use `neptune.init(...)` or `Session.with_default_backend(...)
    WARNING: It is not secure to place API token in your source code. You should treat it as a password to your account. It is strongly recommended to use NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN environment variable instead. Remember not to upload source file with API token to any public repository.
