Description: # Data Bear
        General purpose data aquistion, processing, and logging platform written in Python.
        
        ### Goals:
        * Easy to use - intuitive setup and configuration.
        * Versatile - use on any hardware device that runs Python.
        * Extendible - add new methods for measurement as needed.
        
        ### Example uses (methods still under development):
        * Read a temperature sensor using Modbus communications every minute and record the data to CSV.
        * Measure soil moisture using SDI-12 communications every 5 minutes, average to hourly, and save as CSV.
