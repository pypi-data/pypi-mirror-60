Description: # pHashPy
        
        **Python bindings for the [pHash](https://github.com/aetilius/pHash) (perceptual hashing) library.**

        The project uses cppyy to create a small wrapper around pHash functions.
        
        ## Features
        
        Working:
         
        - Video hashing
        - Image hashing (dct & mh)
        
        Missing:
        
        - Audio
        - Text
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### As a Command Line Tool
        
        You can use the tool as a command line utility to generate a list of hashes from a list of files.
        
        Run `python -m pHashPy --help` for more info.
        
        ### As a Library
        
        Import functions from the package's `__init__`, this will automatically load the required library files.
        If you import the functions from the individual py files, you must call `helper.init` yourself.
