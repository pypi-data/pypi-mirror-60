# Sprite Sheet
This project develops a uitility box which uses to generate a sprite sheet
## Documentaion
The project contains six different parts, include:
#### [Waypoint 1: Find the Most Common Color in an Image](https://github.com/intek-training-jsc/sprite-sheet-tcthai/tree/waypoint1) 
* This function is a tool developed to find the most common color which can be considered as the background color.
#### [Waypoint 2: Write a Class Sprite](https://github.com/intek-training-jsc/sprite-sheet-tcthai/tree/waypoint2)
* This class is developed to generate a sprite instance which contains the sprite's parameter itself.
#### [Waypoint 3: Find Sprites in an Image](https://github.com/intek-training-jsc/sprite-sheet-tcthai/tree/waypoint3)
* This function is developed to generate a label map and sort out each sprite in the input image.
#### [Waypoint 4: Draw Sprite Label Bounding Boxes](https://github.com/intek-training-jsc/sprite-sheet-tcthai/tree/waypoint4)
* This function is developed to create a sprite sheet and its bounding box from a label map and a list of sprite object in the label map itself.
#### [Waypoint 5: Write a Class SpriteSheet](https://github.com/intek-training-jsc/sprite-sheet-tcthai/tree/waypoint5)
* This class is a automatic machine which have two build-in functions to create a sprite sheet image or a label map and a list of sprite object directly from the instanitiated image.
#### [Waypoint 6: Package and Distribute the Python Library](https://github.com/intek-training-jsc/sprite-sheet-tcthai/tree/waypoint6)
* This is a pakaging process to create a downloadable and installable distribution of the library for users to easily download, install and use as a python buid-in library
## Usage
* This lib is comparable with [python3] only. if you don't have one, you can download the latest version [here](https://www.python.org).
* Get source code from git or a distribution of the library from PyPI, for example:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/intek-training-jsc/sprite-sheet-tcthai.git
```
* Import and use the library as any other buid-in lib. Example:
```python
>>> from spriteutil.spritesheet import SpriteSheet
>>> sprite_sheet = SpriteSheet('some_image.png')
>>> sprites, labels = sprite_sheet.find_sprites()
>>> image = sprite_sheet.create_sprite_labels_image()
>>> image.save('barbarian_bounding_boxes.png')
```
